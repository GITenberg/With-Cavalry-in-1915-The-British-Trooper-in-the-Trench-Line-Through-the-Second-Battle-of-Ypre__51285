<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The more than kind reception that Press and
Public accorded my first book on the War,
"From Mons to Ypres with French," has
encouraged me to put together a chronicle of
further events.</p>

<p>"With Cavalry in 1915" takes up the
thread of its narrative where its predecessor
left it&mdash;with the closing days of 1914.</p>

<p>If some notes of frank criticism have been
included in this volume, it has been with no
unkindly feeling, or with any other object than
to try to give a fair picture of things at the
Front as I saw them.</p>

<p>My unbounded admiration for the splendid
soldiers of the British Army, gained in the
darker days of the Great Retreat from Mons,
has never wavered in its allegiance to them.</p>

<p>Never have I had occasion to change my
opinion, formed in the first few weeks of the
War, that the British Tommy is worth five or
six of any German soldiers with whom he has
yet come into contact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>In the machinery and organisation of war,
the small British Army was at a disadvantage,
particularly when faced with the necessity of
great and rapid expansion. That mistakes
should have been made was more than natural&mdash;it
was inevitable.</p>

<p>I would not be so presumptuous as to
criticise so freely, but that "the old order
changeth": to write of the past is, I hope,
permissible, and likely to lead to no misconstruction.
I mean no more than that which
the plain interpretation of my simple phraseology
will convey. I have no axes to grind.</p>

<p>The right men are in the British Army,
and the right men are at the head of it.</p>

<p>For its work to be crowned with complete
and lasting victory, it has but to have the
undivided Empire behind it, and that, thank
God, it has.</p>

<p>The man who cannot see that the Allies
will win this war, and win it conclusively,
is indeed blind to what the future holds for
civilisation.</p>

<p class="pfs180">WITH CAVALRY IN 1915.</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">January 1st, 1915, found me in damp,
sodden Flanders. I was one of the
dozen remaining members of the original
Royal Automobile Club Corps, which had
joined the British Expeditionary Force in
France before Mons and the great retreat on
Paris.</p>

<p>I was attached, with my car, to the Headquarters
Staff of the 1st Cavalry Division,
Major-General H. de B. de Lisle, C.B., D.S.O.,
commanding. The Echelon A Divisional Staff
Mess consisted of General de Lisle; Colonel
"Sally" Home, 11th Hussars, G.S.O. 1;
Major Percy Hambro, 15th Hussars, G.S.O. 2;
Captain Cecil Howard, 16th Lancers, G.S.O. 3;
Major Wilfred Jelf, R.H.A., Divisional Artillery
Commander; Captain "Mouse" Tomkinson,
"Royals," A.P.M.; Captain Hardress Lloyd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
4th Dragoon Guards, A.D.C.; Lieutenant
"Pat" Armstrong, 10th Hussars, A.D.C., and
myself.</p>

<p>We were housed in a château between
Cassel and St. Omer. In the latter town
General French and General Headquarters
(G.H.Q.) were located.</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division contained the
1st and 2nd Cavalry Brigades. The 1st Brigade,
under Major-General Briggs, was composed of
the 2nd Dragoons (Queen's Bays), 5th Dragoon
Guards and 11th Hussars. Brigadier-General
Mullens commanded the 2nd Cavalry Brigade,
in which were the 4th Dragoon Guards,
9th Lancers and 18th Hussars.</p>

<p>These troops were billeted in Flemish farms
and villages north of the road that led from
Cassel to Bailleul.</p>

<p>Sir John French's army in the field at that
time was composed of the 1st Army under
General Sir Douglas Haig, and the 2nd Army
under General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.
The corps units were as follows:&mdash;1st Corps,
General C. C. Monro; 2nd Corps, General
Sir Charles Fergusson; 3rd Corps, General
Pulteney; 4th Corps, General Sir Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Rawlinson; Cavalry Corps, General Allenby;
Indian Corps, General Sir James Willcocks;
Indian Cavalry Corps, General Rimington;
and the Flying Corps under General Henderson.
Of the new 5th Corps, which was to be under
the command of General Sir Herbert Plumer,
only the 27th Division was as yet "out,"
though the 28th Division was ready to embark.</p>

<p>Most of the news parcelled out to those who
were "resting" in billets back of the line came
from the London newspapers.</p>

<p>Typed sheets, dubbed "summaries of information,"
and issued by G.H.Q., were distributed
daily, but were never valuable and rarely really
informative.</p>

<p>The G.H.Q. information sheet of January 1st,
1915, read: "The Germans made an attack
on the right of our line, south of Givenchy,
yesterday evening, and captured an observation
post. This post was retaken by a counter-attack
early this morning, but later on was
again captured by the enemy. The line has
now been reorganized."</p>

<p>A friend in the 1st Army, which was covering
the part of the line thus attacked, showed
me the 1st Army summary of 7 p.m., January 1st,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
which added the following to the news on the
situation: "All is quiet in front. Fighting on
right of 1st Corps last night was not as serious
as at first reported. Casualties in Scots Guards
believed to be about five officers and fifty other
ranks. Most of these casualties occurred owing
to the regiment pushing on beyond the original
trench, and attacking the enemy's position.
This wet weather is entailing great hardship
on the men, who are fully engaged repairing
trenches, some of which have had to be
abandoned owing to water. The Germans are
reported to be no better off."</p>

<p>Such brief, dry, official summaries applied to
most of the wet days of January, 1915. Trench
warfare in winter has a very stoggy sameness
about it.</p>

<p>A 3rd Corps advance in front of the Ploegsteert
Wood resulted in several of our men
being drowned while attacking, so deep was
the water in the submerged shell-holes in the
flooded area.</p>

<p>Discipline, the capacity to go forward in
pursuance of an order, in spite of the fact that
doing so seems utterly futile, is possessed by
the British troops to a remarkable degree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Small operations, comparatively unimportant in
scope and result, served to demonstrate daily
the splendid spirit of the men under inconceivably
trying conditions.</p>

<p>One trench at Givenchy was taken and retaken
time after time, and the men ordered to
capture the trench were ever found ready to
"go up" in the same dashing way, though they
knew to a man that the assault meant inevitable
loss, and would more than likely be followed
by a further enforced evacuation, by their own
comrades, of the untenable position.</p>

<p>The Huns were well supplied with trench-mortars,
bombs and hand-grenades, and used
them with great effect. Our men had practically
none of these indispensable attributes to trench
warfare, or at least had so few of them that
their use produced comparatively negligible
results.</p>

<p>The Christmas truce between British and
German units confronting each other in the
trenches produced echoes for weeks. The
order from General French stating clearly that
"the Commander-in-Chief views with the
greatest displeasure" such fraternizing with
the enemy had produced a partial effect, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
instances still occurred where the Huns took
the initiative in the matter of peace overtures
for short periods.</p>

<p>A visit to one part of our front line unearthed
the following story: The opposing trenches
were separated by a highway, across which,
one morning, a German soldier shouted, "Let's
have a truce for to-day. We don't want to
kill you fellows. Why should we kill each
other? We are to be relieved by the Prussians
to-morrow night. You can kill them if you
like. We don't care. We are Saxons."</p>

<p>The extraordinary proposal was taken in
good part, and the truce kept for thirty-six
hours. No men of either army left their
trenches, but not a shot was fired from German
or English trench at that point.</p>

<p>A few miles from the scene of this incident
the men of the opposing armies became quite
accustomed to calling across the intervening
ground to their enemies. Each side, one day,
boasted of the excellence of its food supply.
A British Tommy declared his lunch ration
included an incomparable tin of sardines. A
German soldier shouted his disbelief that
Tommy possessed any such delicacy. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>upon
an empty sardine tin on the point of a
bayonet was raised above the British trench
parapet in proof of Tommy's statement.</p>

<p>"That's a sardine <em>tin</em>," yelled a Hun
derisively, "but there is no sardine in it, mein
friend."</p>

<p>A few minutes passed, then a tin of sardines,
unopened and temptingly whole and sound was
thrown from the English trench towards the
trench of the enemy. It fell short. Over his
parapet vaulted a big German, who dashed at
the tin with outstretched hand. As his fingers
were closing over it, it jumped from his grasp.
Again he stooped and reached for it. Again
it leaped away. Tommy had attached a thin
but stout line to his sardine tin, willing to
prove his assertion, but with no idea of losing
his luncheon.</p>

<p>Two or three times the big Hun grabbed
wildly at the elusive prize, amid the shouts
and laughter of the men of both armies, who
cheered in unison as Hans was at last convinced
of the futility of further effort and retired in
confusion to his trench.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the New Year a trench
full of Westphalians and a party from a section<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of our line held by the 4th Corps, fraternised
to such an extent that visits were paid by each
contingent to the "no-man's land" between the
trenches. When the British soldiers returned
to their trench, they found a man curled up in
the bottom of it. Investigation showed him to
be a German soldier.</p>

<p>"'Ere, git out o' this," said Tommy indignantly.
"You're bloomin' well in the wrong
'ouse."</p>

<p>"No," said the Hun decidedly, "me prisoner,
prisoner!"</p>

<p>"Not you," was the indignant reply. "Play
the gime, you silly old 'Un, an' 'ook it."</p>

<p>But such was not the intention of the Saxon
lad. With hands in air to indicate his abject
surrender, he insisted he was a prisoner and
refused to budge.</p>

<p>Nonplussed, the Tommies shouted over to
the Germans: "'Ere's one o' your chaps 'ere
as won't go 'ome, the silly beggar. 'E's lorst
'is way, poor chap, an' don't know where 'e
are."</p>

<p>"Send him back to us, please," was the
prompt request from the Deutschers.</p>

<p>But not a move would the Hun make, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
at last half a dozen stout Tommies hoisted him
over the parapet with the butts of their rifles.
Still he tarried. With an oath a burly British
corporal called two of his comrades. They
leaped out of the trench, grabbed the hesitating
Hun, and marched him at quick time to his own
lines. There they turned him over to his officer,
presented arms in salute, wheeled and marched
gravely back to their own trench.</p>

<p>"What did the German bloke say when you
chucked the chap to him?" was asked the
corporal.</p>

<p>"Thynks," laconically replied that worthy,
"an' no more, except to sye, 'We'll fix the
rotter.' An' so they bloomin' well should&mdash;desertin'
durin' a bally troose that wye&mdash;the
dirty dog."</p>

<p>As the 1st Cavalry Division was "resting,"
visits to points of interest were the order of
the day. On Monday, January 4th, General
de Lisle, Captain Hardress Lloyd, and I ran,
<em>viâ</em> quaint old Bergues and Dunkirk, to
Furnes, where King Albert of the Belgians
had his Headquarters.</p>

<p>Belgian sentries were plentiful after Dunkirk.
They frequently stopped us, but generally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
word "Anglais" was a sufficient passport.
Now and again Lloyd produced a British pass,
at which the Belgians would invariably look
blandly, if uncomprehendingly, then salute and
urbanely wave us on our way. Any sort of
pass would have served with ninety-nine out of
a hundred such sentries.</p>

<p>The coast district in Belgium was not
interesting in itself. Roadways ran between
sluggish, morbid-looking canals and flat,
dispirited fields&mdash;a sad, soggy, flabby land, in
very truth.</p>

<p>Furnes was a picturesque relief. The
architectural beauties of the Hotel de Ville
and one or two other buildings in its fine old
square were undeniable. Not long after our
visit Furnes was viciously shelled by the Huns.
Later it was practically devastated by big
howitzer shells. Three or four days before
our visit to the town a Black Maria had
landed in a busy spot near the square one
noontide, killing ten people and wounding a
dozen others.</p>

<p>Nieuport, not far away, was under a heavy
bombardment when we arrived in Furnes.
Three days before sixty French soldiers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
been killed in one day in Nieuport, which had
proved so great a death-trap that all troops
had been moved to dug-outs outside the town.</p>

<p>I had a chat with one of King Albert's Staff
whom I had previously met in London. He
was a very outspoken critic of the Belgian
officers, and of the policy that had resulted in
the Belgian evacuation of Antwerp before such
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débâcle</i> was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>We had lunch in Furnes with Colonel Tom
Bridges. I had seen much of Bridges during
the first months of the War, when he was
attached to the 4th Dragoon Guards as a
major. He led a charge at Tour de Paissy,
on the Aisne, which saved the British line.
Promoted to the rank of Colonel, he was given
command of the 4th Hussars. A very few
days afterwards, while on a night march, he
was sent for by General Sir John French.
Arriving at G.H.Q., Bridges, who had been the
British Military Attaché in Belgium prior to
the War and knew the Belgian Army well, was
given certain instructions, placed in a Rolls-Royce
car, and at once started for Antwerp.
He arrived late at night, after a continuous run
of over 600 kilometres, and saw King Albert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
who at once convened a Council of War.
Bridges then jumped into the work at hand
without a moment's delay.</p>

<p>Tom Bridges arrived in Antwerp on
November 3rd. The city was evacuated by
the Belgians on November 8th.</p>

<p>Having heard so much of the prominent part
Bridges had played in the affairs of the Belgians,
I looked forward with all the more anticipation
to again meeting him.</p>

<p>Major Prince Alexander of Teck, attached
to Colonel Bridges' mission, and Mrs. Bridges,
who had recently been at work in the Duchess
of Sutherland's hospital at Dunkirk, were at
luncheon.</p>

<p>Colonel Bridges talked of King Albert.
"The King gives to a stranger the impression
that he comes to a decision slowly. I have
heard men, who have met him, say they thought
him extremely deliberate, but all recognise his
solid foundation of determination. But for
that rock on which the King's stern determination
is set, there would be but little Belgian
Army left to-day. To King Albert personally
much more is due than is likely ever to be
known."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The more I saw of the Belgian Army along
the Yser, the more I appreciated what Bridges
had said of the King.</p>

<p>After luncheon, I drove General de Lisle,
Colonel Bridges and Hardress Lloyd to Nieuport-les-Bains,
once a sea-coast summer resort
at the mouth of the Yser. The Allied trench
line was roughly the line of the canal. On the
coast in the sandy dunes, the Allies' trenches
had been pushed a bit to the Ostend side, but
Dixmude was still in German hands.</p>

<p>Not a single inhabitant of Nieuport-les-Bains
was in the town&mdash;not a man, woman or child.
The French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tirailleurs d'Afrique</span>, part of a
splendid division of French Colonials that had
been sent by Foch to "stiffen" that part of the
line, occupied the ruins of the summer resort
that was. The typical French summer hotels
in Nieuport-les-Bains were, for the most part,
shapeless piles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>.</p>

<p>The Huns never succeeded in actually penetrating
the town, though Von Beseler's troops
tried hard to take it. The Germans reached
the river bank which formed the town's boundary
on the north.</p>

<p>The main thoroughfare was blocked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
frequent intervals by great barricades made
from bathing machines, hauled in a row and
filled with sand and paving stones. Asphalt
tennis courts were scarred with shell-holes.
No open space had been spared during the
weeks of itinerant bombardment.</p>

<p>As we approached the town French batteries
of "75's" were firing hard from positions in the
dunes by the roadway.</p>

<p>The French General Officer Commanding
arrived as we alighted from our car. But one
house was standing in the northern edge of the
town. Into it we filed on the heels of the
French General, up its stair to the garret, and
still up a rickety ladder to a point of vantage
under the very eaves. Through shell-holes in
the tile roofing, French observers directed the
fire of the batteries below. Across the Yser,
in front of us, we would see the French and
German trenches among the low sand hills.
For long spaces they ran but fifteen to twenty
yards apart and in one sector a German sap
was but five yards from the French escarpment.</p>

<p>For a time we watched the shells from the
"75's" bursting over the German trenches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Descending, we crossed the Yser practically
at its mouth. A pontoon bridge, vaunting a
placard showing it had been christened the
"Pont Gal Joffre," led between twin piers.
The bridge swayed and tossed like the deck
of a channel steamer as we picked our way
gingerly across it. Some months later a Jack
Johnson, luckily placed by the enemy, entirely
smashed that pontoon bridge.</p>

<p>Gaining the northern bank we zig-zagged
through deep trenches in the sand, reinforced
here and there with timbers and stone. An
open crater and a pile of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> marked what
had once been a lighthouse. Dug-outs, shelters
in miniature, lined the sides of the crater nearest
the Huns. The open bowl of sand was about
forty feet in diameter. Near its centre gaped
a shell-hole in the soft sand made by an unwelcome
visitor which had come less than a
half hour previously. Digging for a few
moments, I unearthed the still warm timing-fuse
of the 105-millimetre shell that had made
the hole.</p>

<p>The lighthouse position was, the sergeant
of Tirailleurs said, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvais place</i>. From
morning until night of the day before the Huns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
had shelled it. Many shells had fallen in the
hours just preceding our arrival. General de
Lisle and Colonel Bridges left Hardress Lloyd
and me there, "for safety," while they walked
through the front line positions, which were
from a hundred to a hundred and sixty yards
further forward.</p>

<p>I investigated the interiors of the tiny dug-outs
during the General's absence. No shell
fell near, however, and soon we were all retracing
our steps to Nieuport-les-Bains. Once
a sniper spied one of the party, and a bullet
from his rifle kicked up a spurt of sand a few
feet from my head. We acknowledged the
attention by an additional foot or so of "stoop"
thenceforth.</p>

<p>Over a cup of tea at Colonel Bridges' headquarters,
I met an old acquaintance in Lady
Ross, who had that day handed to the Queen
of the Belgians a cheque for £1,000 for Belgian
sufferers. Lady Ross told me of an interesting
conversation with King Albert at luncheon.
After discussing at length the general subject
of the difficulty of realisation of war's hardships
and atrocities by those whose homes have been
far from the actual scenes of war, the conversa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>tion
drifted to the refugee question. King
Albert agreed that all able-bodied Belgians
of military age should be with the Army,
and declared emphatically his intention to
press for steps that would lead to such a
consummation.</p>

<p>The result of my visit to Furnes and Nieuport-les-Bains
was to confirm my impression
that the Germans had fortified their positions
along the coast, and so entrenched themselves
that to take Ostend by direct land attack
was impossible, except at very great cost
indeed.</p>

<p>The assistance that could be given by the
Admiralty to such a project was greatly
discounted by the fact that the ships available
were out of range when outside the sandbanks
that lay near the coast, and outclassed by
the enemy's land batteries when inside the
banks.</p>

<p>Many folk visited the Belgian Army in the
trenches during those January days. Less
than a week after we had visited Furnes, a
couple of us ran to Dunkirk on Sunday to
buy some fresh fish, a delicacy as rare as it
was wholesome. While in Dunkirk I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Lord Northcliffe and my old friend Max
Pemberton, who had come over for a "weekend
at the Front" with the Belgians. The
next day eighteen German aeroplanes flew
over Dunkirk and dropped several bombs,
doing some material damage and killing one
civilian.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, January 12th, General de Lisle
ran to Boeschoeppe, south-west of the St. Eloi
area, to see General T. O'D. Snow and his
27th Division. While waiting for the General
I had good opportunity to see and talk to
some of the newly arrived men. They had
been marched about fourteen miles before
being put into the trench-line, then marched
back to billets when relieved. Some had come
back from eight to eleven miles on foot. As
they were not supplied with changes of socks
or any sort of patent solution for their feet,
and as the trenches were at places knee-deep
in water, a general epidemic of frost-bitten feet
could but be expected.</p>

<p>Limping along the frozen road, with socks
wound about their poor feet, I felt great
sympathy for the Tommies. Before three
days had passed I heard that the 27th Division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
sick-list had been augmented by over two
thousand cases of "bad feet." One Brigade
Major in the Division told of over one thousand
cases in his Brigade alone. A bad business,
entailing great suffering and more permanent
disablement than a little, all for want of proper
foresight.</p>

<p>Small engagements with the enemy all along
the line were constantly taking place. Official
reports teemed with briefly and baldly told
stories such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The following are details of the capture of
a German trench to the north of La Bassée on
the night of the 3rd-4th January.</p>

<p>"Time&mdash;8 p.m. January 3rd, 1915.</p>

<p>"Artillery&mdash;Nil.</p>

<p>"Strength of attack&mdash;One officer, twenty-five
men.</p>

<p>"Distance between opposing trenches&mdash;150
to 200 yards.</p>

<p>"Enemy's trench consisted of a short length
of trench which had been dug outwards
from a saphead, and which was occupied by
one officer and twenty-five to thirty men.
(Two sentries.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Attack&mdash;The attack crept forward noiselessly
to the trench A A, two German sentries
were awake and were bayoneted, the occupants
were asleep and were all bayoneted; the
officer's head was broken in with the butt end
of a rifle&mdash;not a shot was fired&mdash;some men set
to work at once and cut the ground A B, thus
flooding the trench A A.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="b_020" id="b_020"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_020.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"The attackers were only fifteen minutes in
the German trench and left the bayoneted
Germans in the water, which was then running
in from the water ditch. A A was only a
short length of trench without wire.</p>

<p>"British casualties&mdash;One wounded and two
missing. The latter may have since returned."</p></div>

<p>Quiet days found many a British soldier
hard at work over a French-English "conversation-book."
Some of these were hurriedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
prepared and of a character truly extraordinary.
One such book, made up for the benefit of an
industrious young man, contained a question
that, translated, ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Q. Where is the cat of my mother's
aunt?"</p>

<p>"A. No, but the kittens are drowned."</p>

<p>In Vermelles, on January 15th, I took a
dozen photographs showing the devastation
that can be worked by French high explosive
shells.</p>

<p>Vermelles was an object lesson. Held by
the Germans as strongly as any town was held
in front of the French position south of the
La Bassée canal, trenched and barricaded
with wonderful skill, and well supported by a
mass of guns, its capture was only effected
after weeks of sapping and an artillery
bombardment that had up to that time been
without parallel. Its ruins held texts for
innumerable sermons on the newer strategy
of present-day warfare.</p>

<p>A French officer of standing had told me
that he considered the taking of Vermelles
from the Germans a most hopeful sign that
the French could take any and all German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
positions in like manner, if they cared to pay
the price in men and ammunition.</p>

<p>Geographically, Vermelles was in what was
bound to prove a "warm corner." The German
thrust westward from La Bassée, with Bethune
as an objective, had cost the British Expeditionary
Force some of the hardest fighting
it had seen.</p>

<p>In that area our Second Corps, then the
Indian Corps, and lastly our First Corps, with
the French troops at times in action with us,
had withstood a battering that no other point
in the long line from the sea to the Vosges,
save possibly the Ypres Salient, had been called
upon to stand.</p>

<p>The German advance to the westward had
reached Vermelles, and there been held. Their
farthermost line was in front of the western edge
of the town, and close to the main road that
led through it. The enemy was in possession
of Vermelles for a couple of months.</p>

<p>As no English troops had participated in the
taking of Vermelles from the Huns, except for
the assistance rendered by some of our heavier
batteries, we knew little of what had happened
in that theatre save that six weeks of sapping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a mad rush after an unprecedented bombardment,
and terrific hand-to-hand bayonet fighting
in the streets, had resulted in the French
occupation of the town on December 7th.</p>

<p>Our visit had been arranged for us by
Captain Fresson, the French liaison officer
attached to 1st Cavalry Division Headquarters.
General de Lisle, Colonel Home, Major
Hambro, Fresson and I were in the party.</p>

<p>Coming out of Bethune, on the Lens road,
we passed through Beuvry, then through
Shilly-Labourse.</p>

<p>In the fields by the roadside were trenches,
increasing in frequency along the road from
Sailly to Noyelles-lez-Vermelles.</p>

<p>When Noyelles was passed, and we could
glance across the slightly rolling fields that led
eastwards to Vermelles, a mile distant, a little
world of trenches met the eye. Some giant,
prehistoric mole, crazed with pain and bent
on expending his agony on the surface of
Mother Earth, might have so ripped the
fields.</p>

<p>Not rows of trenches, but curved and twisting
galleries upon galleries of them. For the first
time I began to get an inkling of what real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
trench warfare&mdash;the battles of the pick and
shovel&mdash;meant.</p>

<p>At the headquarters of the French General
who was in command of that section of the line
a most elaborate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i> had been prepared
for the party, with the result that it was well
into the afternoon before we left the hospitable
Frenchman and, in tow of a member of his
staff, commenced our tour of sight-seeing.</p>

<p>Most buildings thereabouts were shell-scarred;
some were burned. No inhabitants
were to be seen. The boom of distant shells
was ever present, and now and then one burst
in sight of us. Detachments of French infantry
marched past frequently.</p>

<p>We ran to Noyelles, which was full of hard-as-nails-looking
French soldiers.</p>

<p>There the party alighted, and guided by a
young French infantry officer, who had seen
the fighting over that ground, walked across
the trench-scarred battle-field eastward to
Vermelles.</p>

<p>I followed sufficiently far to gain an idea
of the lie of the land, then returned to Noyelles
and took my car to Vermelles by road, arriving
in advance of the others. This allowed me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a long stroll of inspection, to be augmented
later by a second tour in the company of the
General, with a French Staff officer as escort.</p>

<p>The German first line trenches to the west
of the town were well constructed. Though
they had been considerably damaged by the
rain of shells that had been poured on them,
they were not as badly demolished as one
might expect. Back of this first line of defence
was a second line, weaving in and out&mdash;here
in front, now behind, now through, the string
of houses on the west of Vermelles' main street.</p>

<p>In the southern portion of the town were
the ruins of the Château Watteble. The
grounds of the once imposing château allowed
a sufficiently clear space for still another formidable
trench-line. Behind that the enemy
had placed other lines, burrowing here and
there at points of vantage through the town.
Adjacent to the château were piles of bricks
that once had been a fine farm, the Ferme
Brion, and in front of it, completely demolished,
and bearing no semblance of shape or form
that would indicate its original outlines, was
a chapel, where a German gun had been
placed. This gun, a French officer told me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
had been served gallantly until the French
were but fifty yards distant, when a battery
of the famous "75's" found the range and totally
annihilated the gun, the chapel, and any of the
enemy who were so unfortunate as to be in
its vicinity.</p>

<p>The church, its square tower battered out of
shape, was still the most conspicuous landmark
of the country round. Another sample of
devastation was the brewery, and attached to
it an elaborate dwelling, one portion of which
was built over a metal frame. All the covering
had been torn from the iron girders, leaving
the mere skeleton of the framework practically
intact, a weird sight.</p>

<p>The German trenches and communications
burrowed so consistently everywhere from the
western edge of the town, and on through to
the eastward, that every foot of ground afforded
opportunity for study. These lines of defence,
all connected and fed by approach trenches,
cleverly constructed, with their traverses and
reserve off-shoots, led away for hundreds of
yards to the rear of the front line.</p>

<p>That, then, was the town the French had
to face, defended by machine-guns in splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
emplacements, every position well manned.
The first line commanded an open front of
slightly rising ground, clear of all obstacles and
capable of being swept for 800 to 1,000 yards.
Military science in trench construction had
been aided by ingenuity of a high order, and
hours of wandering over and through the
rabbit warrens made for men, as cleverly as
ever rodent designed his burrow, found one
discovering new wonders at every step.</p>

<p>The trenches proper were for the most part
deep and narrow, stout of wall, reinforced with
every manner of material likely to strengthen
the defensive ramparts and bastions. Here
the thickness of a piece of house wall had
been doubled by sandbags. There the face
of a trench had been reinforced by huge stones,
interspersed with all sorts of receptacles, such as
water-buckets, cooking utensils, wheel-barrows,
and all manner of tins, filled with brick, small
stones or cement.</p>

<p>A woman's bodice neatly tied about a few
pounds of stone, the wooden cover of a household
sewing-machine, loaded with brick, and
even a stout brown-paper cardboard box full
of mortar, caught my eye as I searched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
stoutly-built wall curved round and back and
round again through what had once been
a house-yard. Traverses that demanded
admiration from the most apathetic student
of engineering, loops of trenches that commanded
every front, approach trenches that
wriggled like some great yellow-brown snake
off toward the rear, were perfect each one in
its own way.</p>

<p>Practically every point in the town could be
reached by a German on tour of inspection of
its defences, without the necessity of his leaving
cover, save to cross the roadway of the main
thoroughfare. Beside all this under-the-surface
protection, the shelter of the buildings, all
constructed of brick or stone and strongly built,
was by no means to be despised.</p>

<p>Truly, when the French officer said no place
could be made more secure, there was some
reason for his words. But strong as it was,
and in spite of its splendid artillery support,
the position was one that the French had to
take, whether or no. Six long weeks of
constant work was represented by those torn
and wounded fields that stretched away westward
to Noyelles. Sapping their way, entrenching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>and consolidating every forward step, the
little men in red and blue crept up to a line
varying by from one to two hundred yards,
and even nearer at one point, to the German
front.</p>

<p>But sapping and mining, and entrenching
and consolidating, so valuable in themselves,
responsible for the finely fortified position of
the Germans in Vermelles, and the splendid
mole-advance against them by the French, was
not the chief factor that was to play the decisive
part in the war-game that culminated in the
capture of the town on December 7th.</p>

<p>Gun-fire was the decisive element. To the
beloved "soixante-quinze" was to go the chief
honour. Only a careful personal inspection of
the town could tell one the real story of
Vermelles as I saw it on January 15th. The
camera might assist, and, in spite of the dull
weather, I obtained a few pictures with that
end in view, but the camera could give one the
story only haltingly and in part.</p>

<p>Not one building in all the town was unwrecked.
The French "75's," with some aid
from the British howitzers, reduced Vermelles
to ruins in the most literal and complete sense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Every edifice, from the piles of brick around
the few tottering walls that was once a proud
château to the humblest barn or outbuilding,
was in itself a study. The evidence left by
such shell-fire of its power for evil is of
fascinating interest owing to its infinite variety.
One wall had withstood half-a-dozen punctures
of varying diameter, holes four or five feet in
width, some of them, while its fellow beside it
had crumbled into a formless mass of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>.
Side by side were two houses, one with front
practically intact, its roof gone and its interior
and back portion blown to bits, the other
minus front wall, but still standing, its roof at
a crazy angle, resting insecurely on the
remainder of the building, which, save for a
scar here and there, escaped comparatively
untouched.</p>

<p>It is this caprice of shell-fire that makes
such a veritable hell of it.</p>

<p>Trenches with sides blown in; here a hole
like a good-sized cellar; there a traverse filled
to the level of the ground around it; a gap in
the defence wall in front; iron-work twisted
into grotesque shapes; stone-work pulverised;
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> in piles; with clothing, bedding, household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
implements, farm machinery and gear,
child's toys, religious emblems, personal effects,
and bundles of every description, all jumbled
together in such an odd, unnatural way, that a
laugh and a catch in the throat often came
together.</p>

<p>Vermelles on that sodden day in January
was full of French soldiers in reserve&mdash;men of
the 131st and 262nd Infantry Brigades, some
from 16th and some from 18th Corps units.
The firing line proper was from three to four
kilometres to the eastward. On the west side
of the town a French battery was firing
regularly, the shells singing over our heads.
The German shells were falling frequently half
a mile in front of us.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to discover a French
soldier who had seen the actual final bayonet
attack which won the position. His story was
graphic, but told in few words. The creeping
up to the forward French trenches, the fierce
bombardment, the wild charge, the discovery
that in spite of the fact that the place had been
literally blown to bits, and German dead
strewn everywhere, some defenders still held
on and manned the murderous machine-guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
until they felt the cold steel&mdash;it all seemed so
matter-of-fact, and such a matter-of-course sort
of story in such surroundings.</p>

<p>In each of the yards of the better-class
dwellings and farms, including the grounds of
the château and brewery, were graves of
German soldiers. Many of these were marked
with rude crosses bearing touching inscriptions.
One such epitaph that caught my eye described
the dead soldier as a good comrade; another
as a brave man who had died for the Fatherland.
Many of them bore a simple religious
touch. One grave covered a German officer,
buried by the French after the capture of the
town. The French soldiers had marked his
name and a respectful word or two on the rude
cross above it, in obvious keeping with the
inscriptions the Germans had written on
adjacent crosses raised while they were in
occupation.</p>

<p>In an effort to tell me how full the redoubts
were of German dead, when Vermelles was
at last taken, my soldier guide found that
words failed him. They were everywhere,
he said.</p>

<p>Many of the graves, particularly those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
French soldiers buried thereabouts, were headed
by black or white metal wreaths.</p>

<p>"It cost dear," said my soldier, "and we
paid. But a Boche who lived through the last
few days of the fighting here, and escaped from
that last charge, will be able to tell a story."</p>

<p>The deep cellar of a ruined house&mdash;a mere
brick arched cell of a place without a ray of
daylight&mdash;had been quite habitably fitted up
as a cave-dwelling by the Germans, who had
saved a piano from one of the wrecked rooms
above and cosily stowed it away in a corner.</p>

<p>One or two underground caves just back of the
German front line of trenches, bomb-proofs for
the officers apparently, were ingeniously secure.</p>

<p>Though Vermelles at the time of our visit
had been in French hands for more than a
month, one could find many such souvenirs as
shell-heads and timing-fuses without troubling
to stir the piles of wreckage.</p>

<p>I could, I thought, sit in Vermelles and write
reams of detail in description of the terrible
havoc of war, but I found that mere generality
as to the scenes of desolation wrought in the
town soon used up my vocabulary. The place
was no less a graveyard of brave men than of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
strenuous human effort, none the less to be
admired because it proved abortive. Over all
brooded the horror of war and the more
specific and tangible horror of gun-fire. "Low
trajectory and high explosive are twin demons,
and this is their devil's work," the shattered
town seemed to say.</p>

<p>Knots of French soldiers or visiting British
officers walked about sombrely and spoke in
low tones, as if in the actual presence of the
dead, in spite of the weeks that had flown by
since Vermelles had echoed to the crash of a
bursting shell.</p>

<p>The French soldiers were a tough-looking lot
of customers. A bit nondescript as to uniform,
and universally campaign worn, unshaven, and
mud-plastered, they looked stout and fit for
anything. A friendly class of men, respectful
to British officers to a degree, a fact that spoke
not only of good discipline, but of fine French
traditions of politeness. They impressed me as
splendid war material, and more, as men of fine
character and indomitable determination.</p>

<p>Sport behind the lines began to assume quite
a healthy state in January. Packs of beagles
and hounds and pairs of greyhounds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
brought "out" by enthusiasts, and cross-country
courses with rare jumps were carefully
mapped out.</p>

<p>Alas! for "Le Sport." An order came along
one day from G.H.Q. which stated that "the
Commander-in-Chief regrets that it is necessary
to prohibit any more hunting, coursing, shooting,
or paper-chasing. This order comes into
effect at once."</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Brigade drew up a splendid
steeplechase programme, which the state of the
ground would not have allowed, had no order
from G.H.Q. been promulgated.</p>

<p>A card of "beagle-meets" was issued, and
formed the following somewhat pretentious
propaganda:&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop-capx">Broken car springs on February 1st
took me to Poperinghe, where a Belgian
carriage-maker made a villainous
repair for a considerable charge.</p>

<p>Motor car repairs were fearfully and wonderfully
executed at the front in the earlier stages
of the war. The G.H.Q. shops were not bad,
and once in a while I found clever, conscientious
young chaps in charge of a road-side repair
shop attached to a division, an ammunition
supply column, or some such unit, who had
managed to organise a very creditable "first-aid
and emergency hospital" for the ills a car was
heir to.</p>

<p>All too often some A.S.C. officer in charge,
however, knew as little of the mechanism of an
automobile and how to put it in order as one
could well imagine. I remember one youth,
possessed of a wonderful opinion of his own
efficiency, whose mechanical experience had
been gained in a railway workshop. He ordered
repairs to be done in weird fashion at times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
As soon as he had delivered his dictum and
departed, his chief non-commissioned officer
would put the men right, generally by a complete
reversal of the youngster's orders, and all
would go happily until he might again put in
an appearance, when the work would suffer
proportionately to the time he spent in its
vicinity.</p>

<p>Stories of the excellence of the performance
of individual cars were often marvellous. One
big limousine, which had been "out since the
first of the show," was ever the boast of the
Major to whom it was assigned and of his faithful
chauffeur. At tea one day it transpired that
the car, which the Major was always ready to
declare had run <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans repaire et sans reproche</i>
during the whole campaign, was in the repair
park for its "initial derangement." Calling at
the repair lorry early next morning, I was
astounded to hear the A.S.C. sergeant-major
in charge say to the major's chauffeur: "So you
have done in the old girl again, have you?
Let's see, that's the third time this month,
ain't it? Why the Major hasn't sent the bally
old wreck in months ago to get her put in
decent shape, I don't know. Not a bit of use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
tinkering at her all the time. She's given us
more bother than any car in the division."</p>

<p>How we did chip the Major! Motorists'
yarns bear some odd relationship to fishermen's
stories, so I have heard.</p>

<p>Taken generally, the British cars at the Front
ran most creditably. The conditions could not
have been more trying, and the Daimlers and
Rolls-Royces lived up to their reputations in
fine style. Cars of half a score of makes were
attached to the 1st Cavalry Division while I
was with it, and I studied their performances
with close attention. For reliability and lack
of trouble a large Daimler easily bore away the
honours.</p>

<p>Cold forges and a disinclination on the part
of the smith to light them on an afternoon
necessitated my spending a night in Poperinghe.
The town was crowded with Belgian inhabitants
and refugees, and with French troops of the
16th Corps, which was at that time being relieved
from the trench work by British soldiers, and
was mobilising in Poperinghe to be sent south
and east, detachment after detachment, to its
own dear France.</p>

<p>A winter in Flanders, particularly in Flemish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
trenches, is not a happy experience. The
French were therefore openly delighted at the
prospect of departure to more pleasant and
congenial climes.</p>

<p>I should have had to sleep in my car but for
the kindly offices of a French Staff officer, who
procured for me a clean, soft bed in the Hotel
La Bourse.</p>

<p>An evening among French soldiers, though
they might be tired, trench-stained and campaign
worn, was sure to be a pleasurable one. Songs
from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansons d'amour</i> to grand opera, from
poor Harry Fragson's "Marguerita," to swinging
marching airs of older wars, were sung with
a vim.</p>

<p>The French troopers possessed a suspicion
of the grand air when drinking a toast, carolling
a love-ditty, or roaring out a rousing chorus.
One or two veterans I met in Poperinghe might
have stepped from a volume of Dumas. An
elder one was a bachelor of arts and science, a
man of studious and thoughtful mien. His
comrade was a true Gascon, and a third of the
group was blessed with powers of mimicry that
made us laugh long and loud before the night
was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Every man of them was proud and fond of
his British allies.</p>

<p>French soldiers did not pay the same attention
to cleanliness of uniform and kit that was
given to such details by the British Tommy.
An English battalion, relieved from muddy
trenches, at once smartened its external appearance
to a degree that had to be seen to be
believed. Tommy worked wonders in a day.</p>

<p>The long-tailed blue coats of the French
infantry were difficult to clean, once they became
mud-caked.</p>

<p>The amount of equipment, and its variety,
that the average French foot-soldier strapped
upon his back, was wonderful. I saw one black-bearded
"poilu," with a typical load, start off
with his company for a long, long march, with
literally as much as he could pack about him,
fastened securely by ingenious means. Over
either shoulder was a strap supporting two good-sized
canvas haversacks, one on each hip, both
bulging with food. To his belt were attached
two ample cartridge-pouches, one in front and
one behind. A water-bottle dangled against a
haversack. His principal pack, hung at the
shoulder, was, he told me, full of spare clothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
A blanket, rolled in a sheepskin jacket, surmounted
this and towered above his cap. A
cooking-pot adorned the back of his pack, while
to one side of it was strapped a tin cup of ample
dimensions, and to the other a loaf of bread,
already become soggy in the steady drizzle.
A bundle of firewood at his side, and a roll of
clothing, holding an extra shirt or two, at the
other, flanked him.</p>

<p>My examination of his equipment concluded,
he said he must be off, and picked up his rifle
with a cheery smile. A comrade rushed up
and handed him a sort of leather portmanteau.
He grabbed it without a word, threw the strap
over his head, settled his various pieces of
baggage into place with a strenuous shake,
and stamped away sturdily, with a firm step
and head held high.</p>

<p>He left me wondering that this sort of soldier
should make marching records of which any
army in the world might be proud, yet such
was undeniably the case.</p>

<p>In billets, the British cavalry were having a
thorough course of instruction in the work of
the foot soldier. Dismounted attack, trench
digging, musketry instruction, bomb-throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
classes, and all manner of miscellaneous tutelage
progressed steadily.</p>

<p>I had a look at Ypres one morning. It was
again peopled with a sufficient number of
civilians to give me a sense of forgetfulness
as to its proximity to the German gun positions.</p>

<p>Of all the attributes of the Belgian people,
their persistence in making back to their homes
in a shelled area, as soon as the shells ceased
falling, was the most prominent.</p>

<p>Many of the peasants pursued their daily
round of labour under shell-fire. Many others
left the bombarded fields or villages, albeit
reluctantly, only to return as soon as the shell
splinters had ceased to spatter about.</p>

<p>What feeling actuated them was a psychological
study. They were phlegmatic as a
people. I have seen Russian soldiers perform
feats that were described by different observers
of the same episode as bravery or stupidity,
according to the reading of the onlooker. Was
the Belgian who drifted back to his own or
some other man's home in shell-ruined Ypres
brave or thick-headed? I left one opinion for
another, only to abandon it in turn. A study of
various types in Flanders helped me but little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Hard-worked toilers, whose lives have been
one continual round of labour, are, more often
than not, fatalists. Such lives produce men and
women who accept conditions blindly and uncomplainingly.
A peculiar love of the soil which
they have tilled, and from which they have
sprung, seemed to take the place in many
Flemish peasants of the more definite and
definable Anglo-Saxon or Gallic spirit of
intense patriotism. Many poor folk seemed
possessed of a blind instinct that "home"
was safest, and once "home" was lost, nothing
worthy of preservation remained. Their attitude
toward death bordered on indifference.</p>

<p>Motor-buses were bringing the 28th Division
to the Ypres Salient as I passed on my homeward
journey.</p>

<p>Rumours of an attack on the German line
flew from lip to lip. That night I read from
an eminent French military authority that "to
attack, unless with a definite object in view,
with a very reasonable chance of success, and
with the surety that you can hold what you
gain if the attack succeeds, is a crime."</p>

<p>In the second week in February, at a dinner
in St. Omer, a member of the French Mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
at British Headquarters told me that eighty-seven
French general officers had been "relieved
of their command" since the commencement of
the war. These generals were "sent down"
for incompetency, evidenced in various ways,
to command the troops under them. The
extremely small number of British generals
who had been "replaced" stood out in very
sharp contrast to this total, with which fact
should be remembered the complete difference
as to policy with reference to such replacements
between the French and British War Office
methods.</p>

<p>Early in February, the 1st Cavalry Division
staff was blessed with the arrival of Major
Desmond Fitzgerald (11th Hussars), who took
Major Hambro's place as G.S.O. 2.</p>

<p>The total tally of British casualties was
announced during the first week in the month
as 104,000, having exceeded, in less than six
months of warfare, the numerical strength of
the original British Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>A day "in front," with the engineers, mapping
out new trenches and reserve positions, showed
to how great an extent modern gun-fire had
changed military theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the War, a trench line was sought in
a position that commanded a good "field of
fire," <em>i.e.</em>, that had in front of it as much open
ground as possible.</p>

<p>This war had taught that the most important
item in the selection of a trench position was
the extent to which the line could be hidden
from the enemy gunners. The space commanded
by the occupants of the trench and
the nature of the terrain were secondary to
the cardinal point of keeping the trenches well
out of sight of enemy observers.</p>

<p>Thus engineers might, years ago, select a
hilltop as a trench position, the line commanding
the receding slope to the valley
below. After the experience of the greatest
of all wars, they would preferably place it fifty
yards behind the summit. More than fifty
yards of "field of fire" was desirable, but not
absolutely necessary. A fifty-yard space could
be so covered with wire entanglements as sufficiently
to delay an attacking enemy. Deep,
narrow trenches with traverses to restrict the
area of damage from shells bursting in the
actual trench, and to protect from enfilade fire,
were demanded by the newer conditions, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
great care had to be taken that they should
not be constructed in ground of so soft a nature
that howitzer fire could too easily cave in the
trench sides.</p>

<p>We found it possible to select a trench line
that could be well concealed, which, if taken by
the enemy, would be under perfect observation
from our own gunners and by them easily
rendered untenable for the Huns.</p>

<p>That the British were clever in this work of
placing trenches in invisible positions was
proven by the following report of an interview
in Courtrai with a wounded German officer,
whose regiment had been badly handled when
attacking an English position in the Ypres
Salient:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our artillery cannonaded incessantly the
enemy trench which our company was to storm&mdash;we
could see it in the distance. Towards
evening we were ordered to advance. We
marched forward without taking cover, confident
enough, because not a shot came from
the British trench. We thought it had been
abandoned after the terrible bombardment to
which it had been subjected all day long. To
make things quite safe, when we were 200<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
metres from the trench our mitrailleuses were
brought into action and we gave the silent
enemy another good peppering. Still there is
no reply. The place must certainly be empty.
Shouting 'Hurrah,' we rush forward to seize
it, but we have not gone more than 100 metres
before our whole front rank is stricken down
by a volley from a point much nearer than the
trench we had been shelling, and in addition to
this terrible infantry fire the British quick-firing
guns are brought into play, and simply mow
our men down. Six times we reform to continue
our assault; six times we are knocked to
pieces before we can get going. At last such
officers as are left realise that there is nothing
to be done, and we retreat to our original
position.</p>

<p>"This is how the English work it. The
entrenchment, visible from afar, which we
had bombarded, was not the spot where their
troops were to be found. They were stationed
in small subsidiary trenches in front of the
principal trench, with which they were connected
by means of narrow passages. The
little advance trenches were concealed to
perfection, and the troops sheltered beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sheets of metal on which our German bullets
ricocheted. So we had been shelling an unoccupied
trench and had done no damage to
the place where the enemy actually was hidden.
Hence it is not surprising that our 'assault'
should have proved to be&mdash;for us&mdash;a veritable
massacre."</p>
</div>

<p>Careful study of German methods of counter-attack
were productive of many an idea.</p>

<p>The Hun counter-attacks were delivered
immediately after the loss of a position&mdash;as
successful counter-attacks must be.</p>

<p>A trench which was thought a good defensive
one by its occupants was sometimes
attacked by the Germans, taken, and immediately
transformed into a good defensive
trench from the other point of view. The way
in which the German first line of attack was
followed by a second line, bearing shovels,
barbed wire, bombs, and grenades, and the
manner in which this second line was put to
work, showed that the brain conducting operations
was close at hand, if not actually on
the spot.</p>

<p>The planning and carrying out of some of
these small attacks were worthy of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
praise. Our troops soon caught the idea and
put it into practice with increasingly beneficial
results.</p>

<p>On Sunday, February 21st, the 2nd Cavalry
Division were in the trenches in the Ypres
Salient. The Huns exploded a mine in front of
Zillebeke and took sixty yards of trenches that
were occupied by the 16th Lancers. A counter-attack,
delayed a bit, was launched unsuccessfully,
and cost the cavalry four officers killed,
one died of wounds, one missing (thought sure
to be killed), and four wounded&mdash;ten officers
in all, and about fifty per cent. of the men
engaged.</p>

<p>The Canadian Division arrived in France in
mid-February&mdash;a splendid lot of men.</p>

<p>Trench-mortars and bombs of various sorts
put in an appearance and classes were held
daily to accustom the men to the new types of
trench weapons. A 3·7 affair of gas-pipe,
throwing a 4½-pound projectile, was the most
prevalent mortar. Prematures and accidents
of all kinds accompanied its introduction, and
more than one good man was killed before
the troops learned the intricacies of the bombs.</p>

<p>General Foch was at Cassel with his Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>quarters.
Dinner in Cassel was always
productive of a talk on instructive and entertaining
subjects. The average French Staff
officer was wonderfully "keen on his job."</p>

<p>The French system of espionage was by no
means to be despised. The reports from their
"agents" were astonishingly accurate.</p>

<p>That Staff work should be the subject of
many an after-dinner chat was but natural. The
French view of the difference between French
and British Staff work, compiled from many a
conversation with officers of all ranks, I understood
to be generally as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>British Staff work could not fairly be compared
to French Staff work, because of the lack
of opportunity accorded the British Army, before
the War, to handle large bodies of troops.
Furthermore, the English Army contained many
officers who entered the Army as something in
the nature of a pastime rather than a serious
profession. Some of these officers even went
through the Staff School, though lacking that
devoted concentration on their profession as a
life-work, which characterised their French
prototypes. Very few officers entered the
French Army and qualified for staff positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
who did not look upon a military career in a
very serious light. French Staff officers gained
their steps by force of sheer merit and close
application to their work.</p>

<p>Nothing else counted, they said. Not a big
staff, but one that was efficient beyond all
question, was the French aim.</p>

<p>The British soldier, I found, was in most
instances frankly conceded to be the best war
material in the field&mdash;friend or foe. That the
British leaders often bungled was openly alleged,
but by no means always proven in argument, at
least, to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>A failure to arrange support, a badly planned
attack, bad Staff work here and there, were
quoted in more than one instance.</p>

<p>"It is the soldier who suffers," said one of
the most brilliant Frenchmen with whom I met.
"He suffers in silence. Perhaps he what you
call 'grouses,' but he stands it. The French
soldier would <em>not</em> do so in anything like the
same spirit. The waste of men and the bad
handling of them that once or twice I have
seen on the British front, would ruin a French
commander for ever."</p>

<p>Universally the French officers praised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
General Sir Douglas Haig. He had completely
won their admiration at Ypres.</p>

<p>"But the best of the British Staff work," said
another French officer, "is that it is improving.
The English are not afraid to admit they don't
know, and are quick to absorb new ideas.
Give them time."</p>

<p>I have quoted the more trenchant criticisms
that came to my ears, for they fell from the lips
of the keenest and most brilliant French Staff
officers, invariably those who held the British
Tommy in the highest possible esteem.</p>

<p>These officers were from the class of man one
would choose to put in charge of a dry dock, a
line of railway, a huge business or a gigantic
manufactory. They impressed me as good
"business men." More than a few British Staff
officers I met, particularly in the Cavalry arm
of the Service, were equally clever, and every
whit as keen on their work, but no one who
wished to be impartial could fail to note the
inclusion now and then, on the Staff, of men to
whom one would never dream of entrusting the
management of a large commercial organisation
or the conduct of an important factory plant.</p>

<p>The 3rd and 2nd Cavalry Divisions having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
each done ten days of trench occupation in the
Ypres Salient, on February 23rd, the 1st Cavalry
Division moved to Ypres to take its ten days
of duty in the firing line.</p>

<p>The run to Ypres, <em>viâ</em> Steenvoorde and
Poperinghe, was a trying one. The road surface
was inconceivably damaged and very slippery.
All manner of French and British transport and
general traffic filled the highway.</p>

</div>

<p>In the western edge of Ypres, in front of the
first cluster of houses&mdash;buildings shell-marked
and war-scarred from long bombardment&mdash;three
grimy mites were playing in the dirt at the
street-side. Further on, a trio of little girls in
soiled black frocklets were enjoying a game of
tag. Across the street they darted, under the
wheels of cars and lorries, missing the hoofs of
the passing horses by inches. One bright-eyed
little girl, out of breath from dodging a fast-drawn
artillery limber, took momentary refuge
in a ragged gap in a shell-shattered dwelling.
As we approached the Grand Place more
children were to be seen, then a number of
adult townsfolk. Round the gaping ruins of
the once beautiful Cloth Hall, in the main
square, the number of people in evidence might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>well have led one to believe that the bombardment
of Ypres was past and done with. Ruins,
the work of shells and conflagrations, were on
all sides, but no one noticed them. French and
English soldiers and their officers, with a liberal
smattering of civilian Belgians, filled the pavements.
Down the Rue de Menin, at the
approach of the Menin Bridge, we found the
headquarters of General Hubert Gough, of the
2nd Cavalry Division, located in a brewery
standing in the shadow of the high moat wall.
The trenches lay, roughly, three miles beyond
the city walls to the eastward. The junction of
the British left with the French right was south
of the Menin Road, in front of Zillebeke. The
trenches we were to occupy ran east and west
and faced south.</p>

<p>Detachments of sturdy French infantry
marched past, their uniforms faded to a pale
blue. With swinging step, each individual
marched to his own time. I admired their fit
and willing appearance. They were campaign-worn
as to kit and clothing, but campaign-hardened,
rather than worn, as to themselves.</p>

<p>A constant stream of people came and went.
How long would the civilian population of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Ypres remain to pay its toll of dead whenever
the Germans decided further to shell the town?</p>

<p>Three women passed, two of them bearing
month-old babies in their arms. Noting my
interested glance they smiled and waved as they
trudged on. What a place for a baby!</p>

<p>An old bent crone, crowned with a richly
beaded bonnet of ancient type, in odd incongruity
to the ragged condition and mean
original state of the remainder of her apparel,
hobbled along, pausing now and again to pick
up and store safely in her apron small pieces of
coal that had been dropped from a passing
wagon.</p>

<p>More French soldiers passed. Then a couple
of British officers rode by in the picturesque
uniform of some Scotch regiment of the line.
A transport wagon rumbled by, and behind it
came a young girl, with a bucket of water on her
head, smilingly exchanging banter with a soldier
of the British military police, at the corner of
the street.</p>

<p>It was a quiet Spring afternoon, a bit overcast.
Hardly to be called lowering, and yet of
a stillness that seemed ominous. A day to fit
all the mixture of folk going stolidly, carelessly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gaily, or how they would, about their daily
tasks.</p>

<p>No one seemed to realise that they were in
Ypres&mdash;the Ypres which had so often been
shattered by shell that the poor old town could
hardly be surprised by any sort of new shell-caprice.
No one saw the rent walls and gaping
holes in every other building. I wondered if
they could hear the guns! I could do so. They
were hard at it every moment, all the time,
from two to three miles distant. It was the old
story of familiarity breeding contempt; or
perhaps they were true philosophers, these
Ypres folk.</p>

<p>General de Lisle ran to Potijze, to the headquarters
of General Lefebvre, who commanded
the French 18th Division. It seemed ages
since I had been in Potijze. Our headquarters
were not far beyond it in November, 1914,
during the great first battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>On the way from Ypres along the Zonnebeke
road we passed bunches of odd little French
horse transport wagons. The road was very
bad. We progressed in crawfish fashion, most
of the way. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i> was torn terribly by
shell-fire, and there was sufficient mud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
slime on it to make it extremely slippery.
French soldiers were billeted in the dwellings
along the road. At the edge of Potijze a dozen
young boys and girls stood outside a house.</p>

<p>Returning to General Gough's headquarters
we "took them over," as that night we were to
relieve the 2nd Cavalry Division troopers in the
trench line.</p>

<p>General de Lisle and Colonel Home ran up
the Menin Road a kilometre or so, and, leaving
the car, walked across the fields past the ruins
that will always bear the name of "Cavan's
House."</p>

<p>The General told me to put the car in the
shelter of a house on the south side of the road,
as shell-fire and the Menin Road were never
strangers for long. I settled down to wait until
the General had concluded his rounds of the
prospective positions.</p>

<p>The Ypres-Menin Road will be remembered
oh! so long, and oh! so well. It saw rough
times.</p>

<p>Field guns near by started to work, and now
and then German shells dropped in a field
beyond.</p>

<p>The house behind which I was sheltered, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
case of a stray shell, was a one-storey affair of
modest mien.</p>

<p>Those of its windows which were not shattered
were shuttered. Half of the roof had been
shorn of its tiles. A shell had wrecked the
interior of one end of the building. A glance
out of a rear door-way showed a whole collection
of shell-holes in the yard a few feet distant.</p>

<p>A door that still remained in position bore
four lines of legend:</p>

<p class="noindent pad8" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
"Vin a vingt<br />
&nbsp; Sous la Bouteille.<br />
&nbsp; Confiture, allumettes.<br />
&nbsp; Bougies, chocolate."<br />
</p>

<p>Glancing through one of the remaining panes
of a window by the door, I saw a glass jar containing
a couple of sticks of chocolate, beside it
three jars of jelly, a box of French matches, a
blue paper packet of half a dozen candles, a
score of small oranges in one box, and in another,
alongside it, seven or eight very dry-looking
kippers. Peering through the partly-obscured
glass one could see a stolid-looking, red-faced,
albino-haired woman.</p>

<p>"Business as usual," with a vengeance! Such
an odd curiosity shop as this was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
passed without examination, so I entered and
talked to the woman.</p>

<p>Her whole stock-in-trade was what I had
seen through the window. She was cheerful
enough, though she huddled for warmth over
a fire by which sat a despondent-looking
brother. She chatted laconically about the
situation, and told me she had been there
continuously throughout the fighting. The
shell that hit the building was a shrapnel and
came a month before. Shells still came near,
now and again, but that fact seemed to be
accepted by her as inevitable and not to be
worried about. These people had no means
of existence except the sale of their pitiable
bits of provisions. They were in daily danger
of their lives. Yet they stayed on&mdash;odd folk.
Typical Belgians.</p>

<p>The gun-fire dropped, then began again
spasmodically. I could hear the snipers at
work. In the gathering twilight the rattle of
rifle fire and the storm of the rapid-fire guns
sounded clearly on the left. A fusillade on the
right reminded me that the Ypres position was
a salient. Directly in front, down that Menin
Road, which had seen the taking of so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
tens of thousands of lives during the past
months, a roll of rifle fire made waves of
sound.</p>

<p>Night fell, cold and damp. The making of
a light was not permitted; so I waited in the
dark, watching the night lights rise and fall
over the trenches, until the General and
Colonel Home returned, when we ran back
to Ypres for dinner.</p>

<p>My first four days in Ypres were uneventful.
On the fifth, I went up into the trenches, and
saw more of actual trench conditions than I
had seen for some time.</p>

<p>Our daily round led me out on the Menin
Road, well towards Hooge, or to Potijze on
the Zonnebeke Road, several times each day.
Shells went over us now and again. Rarely
did a day pass when the Huns did not bombard
the railway station in Ypres. As we were
quartered in the eastern edge of the town the
shells aimed at the station bothered us but
little. Sometimes a Black Maria lit on the
moat wall, where we walked at times, but we
timed our exercise so that our promenade
and the arrival of the big shells never coincided.
Once or twice bits of shell fell over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Headquarters buildings, or rattled down on our
paved courtyard, but rarely.</p>

<p>Every morning saw Ypres wrapped in a
snow mantle, which was turned before noontide,
to a coverlet of black mud. No fires were
allowed, except small wood blazes in the open,
as smoke from a chimney would have invited
a shell.</p>

<p>One day I was searching for a shop where
bolts could, once upon a time, be purchased.
As I was going down the Rue de Lille, half a
dozen shells fell near. One demolished a house
but fifty yards ahead. I took shelter in a
doorway, and as I did so a Belgian of woebegone
appearance, his most characteristic
feature a pair of sad, drooping, yellow
moustachios, ambled past me down the
roadway, pushing a wheelbarrow. On it were
three tiny tots, all under four years old. They
cuddled together for warmth. One, round-eyed,
at the crash of the howitzer shells, was
hard at work with a nursing bottle. I warned
the Belgian of impending danger, but he
stolidly trudged on. Luckily, no more shells
came for a time.</p>

<p>The Menin Road proper was never healthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
I spent as little time on it as consistent with
the proper performance of my work. I never
sat for an hour in its vicinity, waiting for the
General, that some shell did not fall near it.</p>

<p>One afternoon shrapnel fell for an hour near
a fork on the Menin Road, which all sensible
men gave a wide berth to when convenient.
Fifteen minutes after the bombardment died
down, a procession filed by the fork, headed
for a graveyard in the direction of Hooge.
A white-robed boy, with red-tasselled black
cap, led the way, bearing a cross. Behind
him came a robed priest, then an ancient,
dilapidated, one-horse hearse containing a rude,
black coffin. A score of mourners, one or two
of them men, the rest women and children,
dressed in their poor best, brought up the
rear.</p>

<p>I wondered that they ventured down that
shell-swept highway. Yet many such pathetic
little processions passed along that road in
those days.</p>

<p>I saw one <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</i> wait for a cessation of the
shelling, then proceed slowly over the ground
that had but a few minutes before been peppered
with bits of shell. It was an odd sight. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
tiny lad trotted in front under a large wooden
cross painted purple. A quartette of little boys
behind him bore a rude unpainted sort of
stretcher, apparently improvised from the
nearest bits of shattered timber to hand. The
coffin, resting upon this frame, was covered with
a dingy white sheet. A mother, bowed and
feeble, followed the coffin. A few youths and
a handful of little girls formed the straggling
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortège</i>, tramping over the snow-covered cobbles,
their eyes downcast and red.</p>

<p>Death was no stranger in Ypres in those
days, but still the Belgians stayed on.</p>

<p>The wall of a ruined building, across the road
from the Cloth Hall, fell one morning with a
loud crash. A column of dust arose. That
many were not injured was surprising. One
woman was killed and a couple of passing
French soldiers hurt, but post-card vendors
were exhibiting their wares under an adjacent
wall, equally dangerous, an hour later.</p>

<p>General de Lisle went personally over the
whole of the line held by his Division. The
1st Cavalry Brigade was in the front trenches
for the first five days, the 2nd Brigade in
reserve. Then the 2nd Brigade took over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
trenches and the 1st Brigade came back, for
the second five days, to the dug-outs.</p>

<p>At points in the line the trenches were knee-deep
and sometimes even waist-deep with cold
mud and water. The amount of manual labour
required to get them into better shape was
enormous. New trenches had to be dug, the
old parapets strengthened, the trenches drained,
and all the while certain mining work must be
pushed on at a rapid rate. In some parts
of the line the parapets of sandbags had
become so thin that a Mauser bullet could
plough through them easily. The German
snipers were at one place only thirty yards
distant.</p>

<p>The drainage of the worst bits of trench, and
the laying of a sort of corduroy road from point
to point, soon made the trenches much more
habitable.</p>

<p>De Lisle was most thorough. Only a couple
of casualties occurred when the 1st Brigade
"took over," in spite of the constant sniping.
Careful preparations of foot baths and relays of
dry socks saved the Division from the epidemic
of "foot-casualties," from which some other
divisions had suffered heavily. A dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
casualties per day were inevitable from shells
and snipers. Those who had to "go up" with
food and ammunition had to cross a dangerous
zone, a certain toll being taken day and night,
in some localities.</p>

<p>Inspecting the trench-line, when the Division
had occupied it but the night before, was a
precarious business. De Lisle and General
Briggs were going over the ground when a
German sniper but fifteen to twenty yards
distant opened fire. Lieutenant Bell-Irving,
General Briggs' A.D.C., received a nasty
wound in the hip. He fell in the deep mud.
Colonel "Tommy" Pitman, of the 11th Hussars,
jumped out into the centre of the trench, and
strove to lift Bell-Irving clear, and get him
behind the protection of a transept. The
bullets flew about the Colonel, two cutting
clean through his clothing, one on either side
of his body, but he escaped unhurt, and pulled
Bell-Irving into safety.</p>

<p>But the trouble was by no means over. A
sharp fire was kept up by the Hun snipers,
which prevented the removal of Bell-Irving to
the dressing station. Captain Moriarty of the
R.A.M.C. came up at considerable risk, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>advised that the wounded officer be brought
back at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>There were no means of doing this save
to construct a traverse of sandbags, behind
which Bell-Irving could be carried. The work
must be done under the heavy sniping fire.
The troopers of the 11th Hussars at once
set about the work with a will, and soon
accomplished it, but not before a private had
been killed and a sergeant wounded by the
German marksmen.</p>

<p>That night a bombing party "cleared out"
the district near that transept, and made the
snipers' point of vantage untenable.</p>

<p>Each night a splendid pyrotechnic display
showed the curved outlines of the Salient.
The German trench lights were far superior
to ours. Each night, too, Ypres was full of
French or British lines of soldiers marching on
in the dark to relieve some of their fellows in
the trenches outside the town.</p>

<p>The ruins of the Cloth Hall, and of the
St. Martin Cathedral by it, formed interesting
studies for my camera. The fine mural paintings
on the walls of the roofless Grand Gallery in
the Cloth Hall were crumbling to bits. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
photographs were the last records made of
them, for they fell piece by piece not long
afterward.</p>

<p>I watched operations at a French Divisional
Headquarters one evening. It was not more
than a mile back of the line. Wagons were
loading, preparatory to being taken trenchwards
at dusk. Timber, thousands on thousands of
empty bags, rolls of barbed wire, odd shaped
completed wire entanglements, metal shields
varying from curved sheet-steel bastions a
dozen feet in length to small V-shaped iron
castings, all manner of wooden troughs, boxes,
stands, supports, periscopes, braziers, rolls of
fine wire, boxes of trench bombs and grenades,
shovels, picks, and many peculiar tools were
among the collection of material that was to
find its way to the firing line. I learnt much of
the business side of trench warfare that night.</p>

<p>The supply of ammunition and food and its
distribution are most methodically managed by
the French.</p>

<p>Taking up giant powder for mining operation
was an item of the day's work. A story
was told by one of our sappers, of a couple of
Irish troopers who had started across the fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in front of Zillebeke as night was falling, with
a good sized load of powder in a box. Shortly
after they left Cavan's House shells fell in
profusion over the route that they had chosen.
Another group started trenchward, carrying
various types of grenades. Howitzer shells
were falling, front and rear, and shrapnel
bursting a few hundred yards away.</p>

<p>A flash and a crash came from in front.</p>

<p>"Them fellers with the joynt powder was
like to be in that shindy," said a member of the
second party. "Close to 'em, it was, sure."</p>

<p>A moment later they came upon a strange
sight. There in the field, just visible in the
gathering darkness, sat the box. Behind it
reclined the two troopers, snuggling close for
cover.</p>

<p>"What are you doin' in this 'ere peaceful
spot, Dan?" questioned one of the second
party as they reached the box.</p>

<p>"Takin' cover the whiles we do a bit of a
rest-like," was the reply. "The divils sent
wan so clost, it shure jarred the wind out av
us, it did."</p>

<p>And they snuggled closer to the giant powder
as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Hour by hour I watched the "75's." Their
marksmanship was wonderful. The rapidity
with which the guns were served was an eye-opener.
The French gunners burst shrapnel
practically over the heads of our men in the
front trenches, to cover the area twenty-five
yards beyond them. One trooper swore a
French shell, aimed to worry sapping operations
by the Huns a short distance in front of our
trenches, came so close that it knocked the top
sandbag off our parapet. Certain it was that
the word was frequently passed to "lie low
while the '75's' fire just above us."</p>

<p>My day to go up to the trenches came at last.
My guide was Captain Bretherton, the Staff
Captain of the 1st Cavalry Brigade.</p>

<p>Leaving my car at the "Halte," a point
where the railway crosses the Menin Road, and
the Zillebeke Road branches off to the south,
we were soon slipping, sliding and ploughing
along through the muddy fields. We followed
no particular pathway, avoiding where possible
fields where enemy shells were falling. The
rotting mangel-wurzels dotted the ground all
about us. Shell-holes in thousands, positions
where French or British batteries had made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>stand, trenches in lines and circles, and barbed
wire entanglements, caught my attention at
every step. Sprinkled everywhere were all
manner of pieces of projectile&mdash;from complete
6-inch German shells, unexploded, to blue
shrapnel cartridges, bright-nosed timing fuses,
and jagged bits of all shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Cavan's House was but a wall, a pile of
shapeless bricks and mortar beside it. Cavan's
Dug-out, a series of holes in the road bank,
roofed with sandbags, held a signal party.
Every day a storm of shell visited the spot,
and Hun snipers made one wary thereabouts.</p>

<p>We walked on, up the roadway, our objective
the Sanctuary Wood. The bullets sang over
us, and shells burst in front with a continuous
din. A path led through the scrub. Entering
the wood, we passed innumerable little individual
funk holes. The trees were in splinters
and tatters. Here I saw an abandoned shirt,
there a khaki cap. My foot hit against a
regulation mess tin, and as it turned I saw a
rifle-hole drilled in its bottom. Now we were
ankle, now knee, deep in sticky mud. Bullets
became more plentiful overhead.</p>

<p>A turn down a muddy path led us through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a last piece of woods, across sloughs of slime,
over a creek, up a slight slope, and there we
were at General Briggs's Brigade Headquarters.
These were a line of dug-outs in the hillside,
a corduroy road winding from entrance to
entrance. A deep approach trench, looking
like a drain, led one hundred and fifty yards
further to the front trenches.</p>

<p>Shells fell all the afternoon on our right and
behind us, and the song of the Mauser bullets
never ceased. At dusk, I was "safe" back in
Ypres.</p>

<p>On my way back through the woods, shell-smashed,
that covered the gentle hills through
which the front line trenches ran, I saw a burial
party.</p>

<p>I stopped a moment, and watched the laying
to rest of all that was mortal of three troopers
who had paid the great price.</p>

<p>Their comrades placed them reverently in
the shallow graves in the soft earth of the hillside,
marking each grave with a white wooden
cross bearing each hero's name, his rank, and
regiment.</p>

<p>Oh, those rows of rude wooden crosses!
What thoughts their memory brings to mind!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Gone now, many of them, ploughed under by
long months of shell-fire, or trampled under
foot by the ebb and flow of battle, as the lines
have swept back and forth with the tide of war.
Gone, perhaps, from the scarred and mangled
hill-sides of Flanders; but never to go altogether
from the hearts of those who knew them,
and who realised their worth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">On March 1st Captain "Babe"
Nicholson, of the 15th Hussars,
who had joined General de Lisle's
staff in place of Captain Cecil Howard, 16th
Lancers, promoted to General Allenby's staff
at Cavalry Corps Headquarters, had to make a
careful map of our trench position.</p>

<p>Captain Bennie Wheeler, 15th Hussars, in
temporary charge of Divisional Signals, also
had duties that took him to the trench line.</p>

<p>As neither Captain Nicholson nor Captain
Wheeler had made the two-mile tramp across
the fields and through the woods, I was
instructed to act as guide. To skirt one edge
of a field was safety of a comparative sort.
To walk along its opposite edge meant dodging
snipers' bullets in plenty. To turn from the
road to a path through the scrub kept one out
of sight of the Huns, while to proceed a dozen
yards beyond the turning would expose one to
a fair chance of being shot, at good range, by
crack German marksmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving our car at the Halte on the Menin
Road, we essayed the route past Cavan's
House that I had travelled a couple of days
before with Bretherton.</p>

<p>Bang! bang! bang! bang! went a quartette
of shrapnel just ahead.</p>

<p>"I don't think much of your route," said
Nicholson.</p>

<p>"I'll change it with alacrity," said I.
"Which way shall we go?"</p>

<p>"I know an old route that we followed in
the days of the fighting last autumn," Wheeler
volunteered. "If we push down the Menin
Road to a point near Hooge, and then turn off,
we can't get <em>far</em> wrong."</p>

<p>"Lot of French were hit in Hooge yesterday,"
I reminded him. "The Huns shell it
two or three times every day, so best not go
too close to it."</p>

<p>We tramped down to the foot of the hill that
led up to the ruins of what was once Hooge,
then passed through a demolished farm. For
a hundred yards, at every step, we sank knee-deep
in the foul, slimy mud.</p>

<p>Then we wound over trenches which were
nearly inundated, and through barbed wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
entanglements that seemed to become more
impassable as they lost their original form,
until at last, covered in perspiration, we
reached a dense wood.</p>

<p>A tiny creek ran deep through a sharp
cutting, in the sheer banks of which the French
gunners had burrowed like rabbits. Battery
on battery of "75's" were hidden in the forest.
Each gun was surrounded by a little hut of
mud and leaves, an aperture left for each slim,
blue-grey muzzle. We passed the first of these
batteries without seeing it. Close behind us it
opened fire, causing me to jump as if I had
been shot. Before we left the wood, three
other batteries went into action about us. The
din was terrific, but the sound of the shells
racing overhead was most fascinating. Each
gun crew had cleared a neat line of fire in the
tree-tops in front of its position.</p>

<p>Over further fields and through another wood
we came upon a most picturesque cantonment.
A French Infantry Brigade in reserve had built
hundreds of mud huts and dug-outs with charming
ingenuity. Dozens of veteran architects,
past masters of rude shelter construction, vied
with each other in improving on previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
designs. As I took a snapshot in the dull
light under the trees, the French soldiers
crowded forward in twos and threes, and
smilingly invited me to photograph their
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maisons de luxe</i>.</p>

<p>Cavan's House, our landmark, we left well
on our right, edging from it the more as we
saw it a very storm centre of fours and eights
of shrapnel that morning.</p>

<p>Snipers' bullets sang merrily above as we
reached the reserve line and Brigade Headquarters.
My work as guide finished, I started
back with General de Lisle, who, having come
up early in the morning, had left his horse in
the wood which sheltered the French reserves.</p>

<p>Mounting, the General pointed out a new
route for my return, shorter than the one by
which I had come.</p>

<p>"Keep that rise of ground between you and
the line of high ground beyond," said de Lisle.
"If you don't, the Germans will see you and
pot at you."</p>

<p>Crossing my first field, I seemed to be well
in the line of spent bullets, as several kicked
up the dirt in the front of me sufficiently
close to make me imagine myself the target.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I lost little time for the first few hundred
yards.</p>

<p>A maze of reserve trenches and wire pulled
me up short. The only path through was a
quagmire. Safe beyond at last, I started collecting
German timing fuses, which lay thick
on the surface of the muddy field.</p>

<p>Not far on my left was a ruined farm. The
sun came out amid the swiftly-moving clouds.
"A splendid example of what shells can do
to a group of buildings," I thought. "I must
get a picture of the piles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>."</p>

<p>I circled the smashed houses, took my
picture, replaced my camera in its case, and
turned to look sunward, as the clouds had cast
a dull shadow all about me. An open bit of
blue was racing toward the spot where the sun
was hidden. Should I wait for it and essay a
further snapshot?</p>

<p>As my eyes sought the sun, a bright flash in
front of me, in my very line of sight, almost
blinded me. A deafening explosion and the
whirr of scores of shrapnel bullets was followed
by another flash. Crash! The second shell
seemed nearer than the first.</p>

<p>The pluck! pluck! pluck! flop! of bits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
projectile striking in the soft mud all about me
came from every side. Little spurts of mud
and water were thrown up close around me. I
imagined I could feel the breath of passing
shrapnel bullets. A bit of stick hit me in the
face, and a gob of black mud landed squarely
over my mouth.</p>

<p>So many mud-spurts threw up in front of
me, on my right, and on my left, it seemed to
me impossible I had escaped being hit.</p>

<p>I must have been in the very vortex of the
shell's storm-centre.</p>

<p>Turning, thanking God I had so miraculously
escaped when death had seemed so near, I
dashed off as fast as I could run, heading
blindly for the general direction of the Menin
Road.</p>

<p>Fear lent wings to my feet as I realised I
had, in my interest in my photography,
advanced into plain sight of the line of heights
of which General de Lisle had warned me.</p>

<p>I had not run a dozen steps when I thought
of my heavy load, in pockets and hands, of
shell heads. I tossed them away as I leaped
on, tempted for a moment to hurl my camera
after them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Bang! Crash! Behind me came a second
pair of shells, whose coming I had dreaded
every second. To my delight, but one or two
bullets came my way.</p>

<p>"I am gaining," I thought.</p>

<p>Bang! bang! another two burst overhead,
throwing their deadly contents beyond me in
the direction in which I was running.</p>

<p>I ducked to the right and ran diagonally to
the Hun line of fire. Panting, I struck a deep
bog. In I went before I realised it lay in
my path. In a twinkling I was in a pretty
mess. My feet sank deep in the slime and
ooze. It took great effort to raise them.
Well over my knees in mud, I felt trapped,
but struggled on.</p>

<p>At last I trod on firmer bottom, and soon
was racing away at much better speed.</p>

<p>Crash! Bang! I could see over my
shoulder that the last two arrivals had burst
over the muck through which I had just
floundered, throwing spurts of liquid mud high
in the air.</p>

<p>The Hun gunners were gradually increasing
their range, though I was well out of sight
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>My breath came in great sobs, but I dared
not slacken.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Two fell behind me again,
but not so near. That encouraged my flagging
footsteps, and I jog-trotted on, until at last the
Menin Road was before me. Reaching it,
I laid down, utterly exhausted. The shells
continued to burst nearer and nearer the road,
and came in fours after the first half-dozen
couples, twenty-four shrapnel having been fired
in all.</p>

<p>Two British gunners, attached to a siege
battery near by, hurried past me as I lay
recuperating.</p>

<p>"Bad place to be, this," said one of them.
"They shell this bit of road every day about
this time. Those two holes were made
yesterday"&mdash;pointing to two cavities not ten
feet from me.</p>

<p>So I pulled myself to my feet and pushed
on for "home," arriving safely enough, though
completely tired out and literally plastered
with mud.</p>

<p>As I was resting at Headquarters, one of the
Staff told me I had "missed some fun" while
"out front." Six Black Marias had landed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the earthen wall of the moat, not many yards
from our brewery quarters, "shaking things up
a bit," but fortunately hitting no one.</p>

<p>Examining my camera, I discovered, to my
great chagrin, that the shutter had been
inadvertently set at "time" when I took the
snapshot of the ruined farm, away from which
I retired in such a hurry. So I missed getting
the picture which cost me such a strenuous
race against the shells. As a solace, my
photographs of the French reserves in the
wood, and of our Brigade Headquarters, came
out quite satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Shells fell not far from our Divisional Headquarters
next day. More than once the signals-men
brought in pieces of shrapnel, quite hot,
that fell in the courtyard, which from that time
began to lose its popularity as a lounging-place
for waiting orderlies.</p>

<p>A run to Hooge, and a wait there in a
dug-out while the Huns threw a dozen shells
about it, was made memorable to me by
Nicholson's reconstruction of a bit of the
fighting over that ground in November, 1914.</p>

<p>Nicholson had been with the 1st Infantry
Division&mdash;a Division that had Haig for a leader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
At the beginning of the War it had come out
14,000 odd strong. In six months its total list
of casualties had reached 34,000.</p>

<p>In the first battle of Ypres its battalions had
suffered cruelly. The 1st Coldstreams had been
annihilated. The Queen's (West Surreys) came
out of the line with but fifteen men and no
officers, the Black Watch with but sixty men
and one officer, and the Loyal North Lancashires
with but 150 men and two officers.
When the Division came back to billets, it was
commanded by a brigadier-general. Every
colonel in the division had been killed or
wounded, and the brigades were commanded
by officers of all ranks. A captain was in
command of one brigade.</p>

<p>It was in front of Hooge, between that town
and Gheluvelt, that most of the heaviest losses
of the 1st Division were suffered.</p>

<p>Nicholson had seen some of it. One night
the Prussian Guard broke through the line on
the Menin Road. Nicholson's squadron of the
15th Hussars, acting as Divisional Cavalry,
were sent to stop the gap. Forty troopers and
forty cyclists, eighty rifles all told, went up.
They had no trenches, as the Prussians held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
our original position. So they lay in a sunken
road near the Herenthage Château. The
Germans occupied a wood sixty yards away,
though neither force knew of the whereabouts
of the other until dawn.</p>

<p>Nicholson sought out General Fitzclarence,
commanding the 1st Brigade, in the dark.
Most of Fitzclarence's Brigade had been killed.
Efforts to clear up the situation had borne little
result. Every messenger he had sent out for
information had been killed. Fitzclarence said
five brigades were to be sent to him, with which
he was to counter-attack. The five brigades
came, and were found to total 1,000 men all
told. Yet with the remnants of his force
Fitzclarence counter-attacked at dawn. Though
he himself was killed, his wonderful men won
through. The position was recaptured, and
Ypres saved.</p>

<p>A glorious page in the annals of the British
Army, though it cost England men who were
indeed hard to replace.</p>

<p>Our 1st Cavalry Division had come into the
line that night, and supplied the reinforcements
without which the exhausted troops could not
have held on much longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Consequently the ground over which those
heroic battles had been fought was of fascinating
interest to those of us who had seen the most
strenuous struggle of the War.</p>

<p>"As to the losses of the enemy," Nicholson
told me, "I once scouted the wood in front
of us. It was a terrible sight. In many places
among the trees I could not set my foot without
stepping on a dead German."</p>

<p>But the work of Haig and his super-men
had been crowned with success. We had held
the Ypres Salient, and were still holding it&mdash;a
glorious record.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 3rd Nicholson
found it necessary to go once more over the
line of our front trenches to verify his map.
I was to go with him.</p>

<p>Rain fell all morning, and we splashed over
the cross-country route to Brigade Headquarters
and the reserve line without incident, bar snipers
and itinerant shells, most of which sang over
our heads on their way toward Ypres.</p>

<p>One portion of the approach trench leading
to the firing-line was so narrow that "Jeff"
Hornby, of the 9th Lancers, A.D.C. to General
Mullens, waded through it at my heels, "to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
see the President (my sobriquet) get stuck
fast"</p>

<p>In spite of the rain, I procured a sufficient
number of photographs to show trench life as
no written description could picture it.</p>

<p>The top of the hill was cut and seamed
with trenches at all angles, some narrow, some
wide. The trench walls had been in a few
places reinforced with tree trunks, though,
for the most part, from two to half a dozen
rows of sandbags served as protection. The
line was rarely straight for more than a few
yards.</p>

<p>The troopers in the front trenches were
either standing about, near machine-gun or
rifle, engaged in cleaning kit or accoutrement,
or sleeping in one of the tiny shelters that
lined the trench sides at the rear.</p>

<p>The fact that there was no uniformity to the
trenches as to height, width, or direction made
caution necessary as we wound along them.
Expediency was the law that governed their
original construction, and experience the guide
as to their alteration and development.</p>

<p>Loop-holes covered with bits of sacking
were marked by pieces of paper pinned above,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>warning occupants not to tarry in the line of
German fire.</p>

<p>By periscope we could see the Hun trenches,
not many yards distant, and dozens of dead
Germans lying between the two lines. The
smoke from the enemy's cooking fires rose
slowly in the damp atmosphere. At corners,
cautions to "keep down" were posted. Snipers'
bullets, heralded by a sharp bark and twanging
musically, kept me down without much warning.</p>

<p>A German sniper's position was pointed out
to me, and I had some good rifle practice
endeavouring to dislodge him, but with questionable
success. The Hun riflemen had learned
to lie very low in front of our troopers.</p>

<p>We passed one of the 4th Dragoon Guards'
marksmen, his eye along the barrel of his rifle
as it lay in a loop-hole. As we came up he
fired.</p>

<p>"Got him?" asked Nicholson.</p>

<p>"No," laconically answered the sharpshooter.
"Got one this morning, though, sir. And I
hope we are not shifted out of this for a day
or so, as there are a couple more of the beggars
I'll get if I'm given a bit of time."</p>

<p>Seeing a trooper of the 9th Lancers whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
I had known since the Great Retreat, I asked
him how much longer his squadron was booked
to be in the front trench.</p>

<p>"Only twenty-four hours or so," was the
reply. "But we could stick this sort of thing
for a week and not kick. They're behavin'
themselves much better as they go on," and he
grinned as he nodded his head at the German
trench. "They're learnin'."</p>

<p>Now and then an enemy marksman sent a
bullet through a loophole in front of us or
behind us as we proceeded down the line,
until we learned to pass these danger spots
without loitering.</p>

<p>Once we found it necessary to double back
along a shallow trench a few yards behind the
main parapet. The ditch we traversed was
deep with cold water, which ran over the tops
of my high boots.</p>

<p>The damage to the trees was so extensive
that shells might be said to have literally
cleared away the forest in some localities.</p>

<p>In spite of water in the trenches, the men
were cheerily comfortable, many of them
gathering around glowing brasiers or cuddling
close to the wall of a cosy dug-out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>An enforced detour nearly landed us in an
impasse. We had taken the wrong turning.
The trench parapet became lower, the trench
narrower, and the cold water deeper. Pressed
for time, we pushed on. At last Nicholson,
who was leading, saw an angle of front line
trench ahead, and ran for it. I followed.
Bullets sang overhead as the Huns got a
glimpse of us, but we ducked low and splashed
through for dear life in record time.</p>

<p>Nicholson became so interested in a view
through a periscope that I took a picture of
him while thus engaged. A genial acquaintance
in the line offered to get a similar photograph
of me. So I took the periscope, waving it
slightly back and forth, and carefully inspecting
the German trench forty yards distant. I
detected a movement on the enemy side of the
line. Steadying my periscope, I focussed my
attention on the moving object.</p>

<p>As I did so, "Ping! smash!" came a bullet
right through the top of my periscope.</p>

<p>"A clean bull," said Nicholson, beside me.
"Are you hit?"</p>

<p>I had been about to call his attention,
when the sniper scored, with the result that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
a shower of broken glass fell into my open
mouth.</p>

<p>I was in great fear of swallowing some of it.
Nicholson, seeing me dance about and spying
a fleck of blood on my lip, thought I had been
hit in the mouth by a glancing bullet.</p>

<p>He proffered help, I prancing about, gesticulating
that I was all right, spitting out glass,
but afraid to speak until I had cleared the last
piece of broken mirror. The Captain entirely
misunderstood my dumb show, and we caused
some merriment among the troopers near by
until I managed to eject the final bit and could
explain that I was not in the least hurt.</p>

<p>When I learned that one officer had suffered
a badly cut eyeball, threatening the loss of his
sight, and another had been seriously wounded
in the jaw and neck by just such an incident as
the one I had experienced, I was thankful to
have escaped injury.</p>

<p>The "trench stoop" was astonishingly
fatiguing. Covered from head to foot with
yellow sticky mud, and very tired, we started
to walk to the Menin Road. The snipers were
more alert than usual, and more than one close
call kept me from thinking of my weariness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Before we reached our car the German batteries
shelled madly at the very point we were to
pass, but considerately stopped firing by the
time we approached the spot where the shells
were falling.</p>

<p>One morning "Mouse" Tomkinson and
Hardress Lloyd had walked down to Zillebeke,
where folk rarely went in the daytime, to
inspect some of the graves in the Zillebeke
churchyard. Hardress Lloyd's brother-in-law,
Colonel Wilson, of the Blues, was buried
there.</p>

<p>I promised Captain Lloyd that if I could
get off to do so, I would go down to Zillebeke
and take a photograph of Colonel Wilson's
grave.</p>

<p>Hearing of my projected trip, Lord Loch,
who was at that time G.S.O. 1, on the staff of
General Bulfin, commanding 28th Division,
asked "Babe" Nicholson to obtain for him, if
possible, a picture of the grave of Lieutenant
Gordon-Lennox, which is also in Zillebeke.</p>

<p>Hardress Lloyd and Tomkinson told us
they had been seen in the churchyard by the
German artillery observers, who had commenced
shelling. I was warned, therefore, that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
photography I wished to do in that locality
must needs be done quickly.</p>

<p>On March 4th Nicholson and I set out to
obtain the desired pictures. I stopped on the
way, at a cemetery on the Menin Road, and
took a photograph of the graves of three
officers of the 10th Hussars&mdash;Captain Annesley,
Lieutenant Drake, and Captain Peto&mdash;who had
fallen in the first battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>Zillebeke was lonely. On one edge of it a
couple of signal corps men were laying a wire.
Otherwise the town, which was in ruins, was
deserted.</p>

<p>We kept under cover of the houses as much
as possible. I obtained a good snapshot of
the damaged church, and then took some
pictures in the graveyard, which was torn with
great shell-holes.</p>

<p>"Remember what Hardress said about the
Huns being able to see us here," I said to
Nicholson. "Let's get out of it."</p>

<p>We started. No sooner were we under
cover of the first cluster of smashed houses
than four shrapnel shells burst right over the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i> roadway, not fifty yards ahead of us.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>I dodged into a house, the walls of which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>minus roof, were still standing at drunken
angles. Doorless and windowless, the house
seemed to offer little protection.</p>

<p>"I don't like going up that road over the
hill," said I. "We will be in sight of the
Huns for some distance. I wonder if this
house boasts a cellar?"</p>

<p>Examination showed a cellar existed, but it
was nearly full of water.</p>

<p>"I guess the cellar steps provide the best
roosting-place," was my conclusion. "Me for
the lowest one for a bit. Won't you share it
with me?"</p>

<p>"I don't like it," replied Nicholson. "We
will be much better out of it. Let's go."</p>

<p>We argued the various possibilities, but
Nicholson was so strongly in favour of
departure that I acquiesced, and we started
away.</p>

<p>We had gone about one hundred feet when
a series of crashes close behind us quickened
my pace. Nicholson turned and looked. I
called to him, and he again came on.</p>

<p>As he came up he said: "Did you see where
that lot landed?" "No," I answered. "Too
close to suit me, but just where I didn't notice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"It interested me," said he, as we pushed
on, "because all four of those shells exploded
in that rickety old house in which you were so
keen on taking cover. But little would be left
of us by now had we stayed, for the poor
building collapsed like a house of cards."</p>

<p>The Germans shelled the road vigorously as
we kept on, but luckily the shrapnel fell behind
us, and we were soon back in Ypres.</p>

<p>That day saw the German gunners increase
their shelling all along the Ypres front. The
trenches occupied by our division were
vigorously bombarded, and several casualties
reported. Ypres itself came in for a heavy
share of the Hun "hate." The windows
rattled and our house shivered as the howitzer
shells smashed into all quarters of the town.</p>

<p>De Lisle visited the trench line, and both
there and on his way back across the fields the
shells fell very close to him. As he entered
the headquarters house on his return, he said:
"From what I can see, most of the big ones
are falling at least four or five hundred yards
from us thus far, but they may shell us out of
this at any time."</p>

<p>The General suggested I should take a stroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with him along the moat wall and watch the
trend of the bombardment. As we walked
along the ramparts, the projectiles screamed
overhead in dozens, seemingly coming continually
closer. The rumph! r-r-r-rumph! as
they exploded shook the high wall and made
the whole city rock with the concussion. The
Rue de Lille was rendered impassable that day.</p>

<p>General Plumer called, and after his departure
I again started for a stroll on the ramparts.
The shells searching for our batteries just across
the moat were a fascinating sight. As I ran
up the steep path, however, a crash came just
ahead, and bits of metal showered about, striking
sharply against the trees beside the path. My
curiosity evaporated instantly, and I came down
faster than I had gone up.</p>

<p>As dusk came, I took Major Fitzgerald to
Hooge, from whence he went through a wood
to the trenches to make the final arrangements
for the explosion of a mine&mdash;the construction
of which had been worked upon feverishly for
some days&mdash;that all might be completed and the
mine fired on that night, our last one in the
trenches. The French, who were to relieve
us, had also constructed a mine on our left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and the two were to be discharged at an interval
of five minutes.</p>

<p>First the French mine was to be fired at
7·45 p.m., and 7·50 to the tick of the watch
was to be the time for the explosion of our
mine, less than a hundred yards away from the
French one.</p>

<p>I was seldom in Hooge when it was not
shelled, and that evening was no exception.
The French had built safe dug-outs under the
buildings still left standing. The château was
completely ruined, as were most of the houses
in the village.</p>

<p>As I was being entertained by a French
officer, who produced a glass of splendid red
wine, some thirty shells burst over us, most
of them of the 210-millimetre type. One of
them knocked off a corner of the building
behind which I had sheltered my car.</p>

<p>Never was a locality more offensive to one's
olfactory nerves than Hooge. It fairly reeked
with all manner of various noxious smells. The
English language contains words of too mild
a character to allow a description of that feature
of Hooge.</p>

<p>The front line was less than a kilometre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
distant. Rifle fire swelled and died away in
long, rattling breaths. I became so accustomed
to the punctuation of my conversation with
shell-smashes and periods of heightened din
from small arms and machine-guns that, when
all would die down suddenly for an instant,
the stillness felt ominously oppressive. The
next spasm of sound came as a relief to the
uncanny moments of twilight silence.</p>

<p>A French engineer officer joined us. He
told us General Lefebvre, the French General
in command of that section of the Salient, had
issued most elaborate written instructions for
the joint explosion of the two mines. The
French mine, he said, had been ready for two
or three days, its charge lying at the end of
a tunnel but two metres from the German
trench.</p>

<p>The hour for the discharge of the French
mine came, but no sound or shock of explosion
came with it. The hands of the Allied watches,
carefully synchronised, crept round to 7·50,
then to 7·55.</p>

<p>Just before eight o'clock a huge bang was
heard by the British sapper who was waiting
in his tunnel, ready to fire his mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"At last," he murmured. "Now I must
count off the five minutes to the second."</p>

<p>A squadron of the Queen's Bays was ready
to rush into the enemy's trench. Ten of them,
the forward storming party, were waiting in a
saphead.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four, and at last, <em>five</em>.</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>The whole earth seemed thrown skyward.
The shock was terrific. Nearly one thousand
pounds of blasting powder had tossed fifty
yards of German trench, not two hundred feet
in front of our line, high in air.</p>

<p>The great smash came as a complete surprise
to the Huns, but, alas! an equal surprise to
French and British.</p>

<p>The explosion which the British sapper, in
his tunnel dug-out, had mistaken for the discharge
of the French mine, had been a
huge German <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">minenwerfer</i>, or trench-bomb,
thrown by a trench-howitzer.</p>

<p>The French mine, inexplicably delayed, had
not been fired.</p>

<p>For a moment confusion reigned. Three
men of the half-score Queen's Bays in the
storming party were hurt. One suffered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
broken arm, and the others, hurled aside by
the unexpected explosion of our own mine,
were badly bruised and strained.</p>

<p>In an instant, however, every man in the
line realised what had occurred, and the Bays
went forward with a yell, occupying about
fifty yards of German first-line trench and the
gaping crater left by the mine.</p>

<p>Fortifying the captured position and installing
therein a couple of machine-guns, they met the
enemy's counter-attacks staunchly.</p>

<p>For three hours and a half they kept the
ground won, but at last were bombed out.
The Huns threw hundreds of grenades among
them, while our poor supply of trench-bombs
ran out in but a few minutes.</p>

<p>I chatted with the remnants of the storming
party when they came back. Many gruesome
tales they told. One German soldier was
blown high in the air, over a fringe of trees,
and found some distance back of our front line,
quite 150 yards from his own trench.</p>

<p>A trooper noticed a movement near a pile of
timber, earth, and sandbags. Peering through
the dim light, he saw a hand waving about
aimlessly. Grasping it, he pulled with a will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
A comrade assisted, and soon they unearthed
a buried German.</p>

<p>The prisoner was a funny little fellow&mdash;a
stocky Wurtemburger in green corduroys and
a knitted helmet. When rescued, he lapsed
into unconsciousness for an hour. He had
been through the first battle of Ypres, he said
later, in which he was the only one of his
regiment to escape death or a wound. Blown
high in air, very, very high, it seemed to him,
he felt a great mass of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> fall upon him.</p>

<p>He told us, in a spirit of resignation to his
fate, that to have lived through the October
and November fighting on the Menin Road,
and be thrown skyward by a mine, then buried,
and still live, entitled him, he thought, to spend
the rest of the War, without disgrace, in an
enemy prison.</p>

<p>The French exploded their mine at one
o'clock in the morning, and by daybreak the
1st Cavalry Division had "turned over" to
them, and was on its way back from Ypres
to billets in a more quiet locality.</p>

<p>Motor 'buses moved the men back, as they
had brought the dismounted troopers up. The
long lines of London 'buses, with khaki-painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
windows, rendering their interior lighting barely
visible, looked odd in the black Ypres streets.
No outside lights were permitted.</p>

<p>To hear one bell, see the dark shape of the
clumsy vehicle slow down, then hear the two
bells that signalled departure, next the grinding
crunch of gears, and finally, to see the ghostly
'bus slide forward in the night, brought strange
parodies of London memories.</p>

<p>General de Lisle had planned to leave Ypres
at twelve noon on March 5th. We left half
an hour earlier, by chance. Next day we
learned that ten minutes after our departure a
Black Maria struck the very building we had
occupied during our ten days' stay in Ypres,
blowing the back of it through its front, and
generally demolishing the premises.</p>

<p>One day, subsequently, I visited the house
to learn if so strange a coincidence of timely
evacuation was true, and found that the story
was correct in every detail. The interior of
the place was one mass of smashed walls and
partitions, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> bulging from the doors
and windows of the front of the building, which
still remained practically intact.</p>

<p>The handling of the Division during its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
occupation of the Ypres trenches reflected great
credit on General de Lisle.</p>

<p>We left our trenches in much better shape
than that in which we had found them. Some
casualties were inevitable, but the total number
of men killed was only eleven during the ten
days, a low percentage when the strength of
the Division, not far short of 2,500 rifles in the
line, was considered.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the morning of March 10th
the British attack was launched which was to
become known to history as the battle of
Neuve Chapelle.</p>

<p>For several days the weather had been cold,
raw and damp. On some days it rained and
blustered, while at night snow fell, and the
wind howled unceasingly. The morning of
the 9th dawned clear and cold, the stormy
weather having been driven away by a hard
frost. The Tommies in the trench line were
treated to every vagary of the treacherous
climate of Flanders in March.</p>

<p>My car indulged in periodical attacks of the
dumps and finally became a nuisance. Accordingly
I ran to Sailly, where the Canadian
Divisional Headquarters were located, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sought the Divisional Repair Park, which
proved to be at Merville. On the 8th I left
the car in the hands of the Canadian boys for
a few days' repair. On the Canadian front I
learned from an acquaintance of a projected
attack of considerable magnitude, spurring me
on toward getting my car in runnable shape at
the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>On March 9th, in Merville, I saw Sir
Douglas Haig's Special Order to the First
Army, issued that day, which read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We are about to engage the enemy
under very favourable conditions. Until
now in the present campaign, the British
Army has, by its pluck and determination,
gained victories against an enemy greatly
superior both in men and guns. Reinforcements
have made us stronger than
the enemy in our front. Our guns are
now both more numerous than the enemy's
are and also larger than any hitherto used
by any army in the field. Our Flying
Corps has driven the Germans from the
air.</p>

<p>"On the Eastern Front, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
South of us, our Allies have made marked
progress and caused enormous losses to
the Germans, who are, moreover, harassed
by internal troubles and shortage of
supplies, so that there is little prospect at
present of big reinforcements being sent
against us here.</p>

<p>"In front of us we have only one
German Corps, spread out on a front as
large as that occupied by the whole of our
Army (the First).</p>

<p>"We are now about to attack with
about forty-eight battalions a locality in
that front which is held by some three
German battalions. It seems probable,
also, that for the first day of the operations
the Germans will not have more than four
battalions available as reinforcements for
the counter-attack. Quickness of movement
is therefore of first importance to
enable us to forestall the enemy and
thereby gain success without severe
loss.</p>

<p>"At no time in this war has there been
a more favourable moment for us, and I
feel confident of success. The extent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that success must depend on the rapidity
and determination with which we advance.</p>

<p>"Although fighting in France, let us
remember that we are fighting to preserve
the British Empire and to protect our
homes against the organised savagery of
the Germany Army. To ensure success,
each one of us must play his part, and fight
like men for the honour of Old England."</p></div>

<p>In the evening when I returned to 1st
Cavalry Division Headquarters I found the
servants packing. My servant said on my
arrival, "Your kit is ready, sir. We are to
shift out of this at six o'clock in the morning.
A big push is on."</p>

<p>The Cavalry was to "stand by," in case the
infantry attack succeeded and a hole was made
in the German line.</p>

<p>The guns began before daylight, and
hundreds of them, with an amplitude of
ammunition, made a pandemonium.</p>

<p>I begged a ride in a G.H.Q. car and found
myself during the forenoon near the headquarters
of General Davies of the 8th
Division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Not many days before, General de Lisle
had called at Estaires, and we had been
hospitably given lunch by General Davies,
when we had learned something of the general
topography of the line on the 8th Division
front. The ground in that sector was so
water-logged and soft that it did not admit
of the construction of a trench line such as
we had held in the Ypres Salient. Each
small point of vantage to the east of Laventie&mdash;a
house here, or a rise of ground there&mdash;had
been made into miniature forts by the British
or the Germans. A trench line proper existed,
but consisted, from the nature of the terrain,
of trench-works and parapets of sandbags, all
above ground. These were less impregnable
than a trench line in solid ground, and could
much more easily be demolished by shell-fire.</p>

<p>The road from Estaires to La Bassée, on
the morning of March 10th, was full of advancing
troops and returning wounded. General
Davies' headquarters were said to be at Rouge
Croix, not far west of the town of Neuve
Chapelle.</p>

<p>I did not go as far as the cross roads at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Rouge Croix, as that point was under heavy German
shell-fire.</p>

<p>Little could I see except the enemy's shells,
and still less could I learn. That the 8th
Division had taken the front line German
trenches was common rumour.</p>

<p>Finally a wounded subaltern, a mere boy,
came back, hysterically cheerful in spite of a
nasty wound in his arm. He belonged to the
25th Brigade&mdash;Lincolns, Dorsets, Rifle Brigade
and Wiltshires.</p>

<p>"We took Neuve Chapelle," he said.
"Many casualties? Yes, plenty. You see,
we had orders to take the bally town at all
costs, and we did it!"</p>

<p>He was sure his fellows had the ridge that
commanded Aubers, and had heard that our
men on the right had reached a point a couple
of miles beyond La Bassée. Cheerful lad,
that. Neither the Auber Ridge nor La
Bassée was to be ours, but it was not for
lack of his sort. He and his kind, with the
men behind them that fought that day at
Neuve Chapelle, could have taken Aubers and
Lille beyond it had someone not blundered
that 10th of March.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Weeks passed before the occurrences of that
fateful day were made clear to me. Every sort
of rumour was afloat. On the 10th and the
11th I was between Merville (where General
Haig had his headquarters), Estaires and
Laventie, but no one seemed to know in those
days as to just why things had gone so badly
when the promise of success had been so
great.</p>

<p>Later I knew.</p>

<p>General Haig had been quite reasonably
correct in his estimate of the enemy's strength.
Our chance to break through the German line
was the finest opportunity of the whole war.</p>

<p>That, with such odds in our favour, with
a preponderance of guns and shells as well,
we should have so signally failed, and lost over
18,000 men into the bargain, required some
explanation.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Neuve Chapelle was a failure
to take advantage of an initial success. The
25th Brigade, with the 23rd Brigade on its left,
nobly did the work assigned to it. It took
Neuve Chapelle itself, and reached the position
it had hoped to reach. The 24th Brigade was
to come up, through the 23rd and 25th Brigades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and as it advanced, the 20th Brigade, on its
left, was to move forward. Still to the left
of the 20th Brigade the 21st Brigade was in
readiness, and on its left the Northamptonshire
Yeomanry, which had been put into the
trenches previously occupied by the 20th
Brigade, to free that command for the attack.</p>

<p>Thus, once the preliminary ground-clearing
was done by the 23rd and 25th Brigades on
the right, and the town of Neuve Chapelle was
taken, the 24th Brigade was to come on and
form the right of a line composed of itself, the
20th and 21st Brigades, which were to pivot
on the Northamptonshire Yeomanry and sweep
over the Auber Ridge.</p>

<p>On the left of the Yeomanry waited the
22nd Brigade, ready to jump forward the
moment this swinging movement had developed.</p>

<p>The initial success won, the whole line
waited, eyes on the right, for the signal to
go on. Before nine o'clock in the morning
all was ready, and the road cleared.</p>

<p>All day the watchers waited in vain.</p>

<p>It was after four o'clock in the afternoon
before the word came.</p>

<p>It was then too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The great opportunity had been lost, and
lost for ever.</p>

<p>The Germans had rallied, filled farms with
machine-guns, and mowed down the gallant
23rd and 25th Brigades men who had so dearly
won such splendidly advanced positions.</p>

<p>The 24th Brigade had come on part way,
then concentrated, and was sadly cut up. That
the line on the right had "dug-in," instead of
moving forward, had resulted in a defeat when
a great victory was within grasp.</p>

<p>And who was to blame?</p>

<p>A Brigade commander and the General in
command of the artillery of a certain division
were promptly "Stellenbosched." A divisional
commander was reported sent home; his case
reopened when he declared the fault was not
his, as could be proven by certain hitherto
unproduced papers from corps headquarters.
A further inquiry resulted in his being reinstated.
His corps commander went to
England. "Sent home," said many. Shortly
afterwards, back he came, to the discomfiture
of the prophets, and took up his old command.</p>

<p>Who was to blame?</p>

<p>It is too early to tell. Let the writers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
future dig the story out of the tangled orders
of the day, as between corps and division,
division and brigade.</p>

<p>No battle of such magnitude could be won
without fine Staff work, and the work of more
than one staff on that 10th of March left much
to be desired.</p>

<p>One thing cannot be gainsaid. The men in
the ranks fought like heroes. Nothing that
men could do was left undone by them.</p>

<p>One officer who saw as much of Neuve
Chapelle, and knew as much of the tragedy as
any one man said to me: "The word 'concentrate'
caused all the trouble. The troops
that might so easily have come on had orders
to concentrate along a certain road. That was
the root of the mix-up. They concentrated,
dug-in, and waited for orders, in accordance
with their instructions. Those instructions did
not come until half past four in the afternoon.
The whole day had been wasted. The time
had flown, and the great opportunity with it."</p>

<p>The cavalry would have had a fine part to
play had all gone well.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Division was drawn up
back of Estaires, the 3rd Cavalry Division in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the Forest of Nieppe, and the 1st Cavalry Division
was ready at its billets. A hole in the
German line meant a strong push through by
the three cavalry divisions.</p>

<p>On the right of the 7th and 8th Divisions
the Indian Corps had hard fighting, the day of
the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. The Gurkhas,
one of their officers told me, took a wood, lost
it, took it a second time, lost it again, and a
third time took it, only to be driven out at last
owing to the fact that no support was available.</p>

<p>On a visit to Bethune one day I heard
dozens of stories of the fierce fighting on
March 10th, on the 2nd Division front, where
one Brigade lost twenty-five officers and seven
hundred men in an abortive attack.</p>

<p>But the interest centred around the
8th Division fighting, that began so well,
then hung fire until the Germans recovered
from the demoralization of the smashing blow.</p>

<p>How utter was that demoralization we learned
later from "agents" near Lille and Tournai.
The Germans were actually "on the run" that
morning, and pressing forward would have indubitably
borne results that would have loomed
large in the trend of events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>On March 15th, the 1st Cavalry Division was
called out at dawn, and placed in support of
the 27th Division at St. Eloi. Just before six
o'clock on the evening of the 14th, the Huns
had fired a mine at St. Eloi, and then poured a
rain of high explosive shells over our trenches
for half an hour. The howitzer shells exploded
so rapidly, that one continuous roar ensued,
the separate detonations being with difficulty
distinguished.</p>

<p>The moment the German guns stopped their
fusilade, the German infantry rushed forward,
the attack developing all along the 5th Corps
front. St. Eloi itself, the southern re-entrant
of the Ypres Salient, was soon in enemy hands.</p>

<p>By two o'clock on the morning of the 15th,
a British counter-attack was launched. By
daybreak each force held some part of St. Eloi,
and the fighting grew fierce and fiercer. By
night all the town was in British hands save
one point, a mound which had been transformed
into a kind of fort by the enemy.</p>

<p>During that fighting, the 4th Battalion Rifle
Brigade was sent up to take a section of trench
out of which one of the other 27th Division
Battalions had been shelled. Once before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
within the hour, another battalion had essayed
to recapture the lost position, and had "retired"
in considerable confusion.</p>

<p>The Rifle Brigade set its teeth and started
for the hottest part of the fray.</p>

<p>"You must cross that road," its commander
was told, "though Heaven only knows how
anyone can get across it alive."</p>

<p>Sixteen Hun machine-guns were playing on
the open space over which the battalion must
pass.</p>

<p>Over it they went. In less than sixty
seconds eleven officers and two hundred and
fifty men were down, but the rest pushed on.</p>

<p>They reached the trench, some of them,
cleared out the Huns with the cold steel, and
consolidated the position&mdash;a splendid performance.</p>

<p>The 5th Corps made good the ground the
Germans had won without calling on the
1st Cavalry Division troops for assistance, and
thus ended the last chance of our Division for
active fighting during the month of March.</p>

<p>Inspections in the Flemish mud, bright sunshine
and spring zephyrs one day, and snow
the next, and more than once snow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sunshine alternating throughout the span of a
day, marked the passing of the month.</p>

<p>Paris, Calais, St. Omer, Estaires, Lillers,
Merville and Hazebrouck were visited by enemy
airmen as the days went by, and bombs
dropped, but without much damage to lives or
property.</p>

<p>"The Huns don't care whether or not they
hit anything," said one sage "sub." "They
only want to show Sir Douglas Haig they
have a copy of that March 10th Order of his
wherein he said 'Our Flying Corps has driven
the Germans from the air.'"</p>

<p>On March 25th I spent the morning in
Bailleul at 2nd Corps and 3rd Corps Headquarters.</p>

<p>The Staffordshire Brigade of the North
Midland Territorial Division marched past to
the music of their fine brass band, drawn up in
the square&mdash;the first band I had seen or heard
since leaving England seven months before.
Crowds of soldiers and officers flocked to
hear it and see the sturdy Terriers march by
with swinging step. They created a splendid
impression.</p>

<p>The next day my work was to take General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Lowe and General Lumley over the path of
the early fighting in Flanders&mdash;from Meteren
through Bailleul to Armentières, thence to
the line on the Ploegsteert Hill and through
the Ploegsteert Wood.</p>

<p>We stopped in the town of Ploegsteert,
where, in the churchyard, General Lumley's
son, a gallant young officer in the 11th Hussars,
was buried.</p>

<p>The boy had been killed on October 17th,
when our Division was trying to force a way
across the River Lys. At Le Touquet Lieutenant
Lumley was reconnoitring a position
preparatory to an advance when a German
sniper's bullet struck him.</p>

<p>As the General visited his son's grave I
learned from townsfolk how things had fared
with them.</p>

<p>Months before the 1st Cavalry Division had
been the first British contingent to enter
Ploegsteert. The people told me of the severe
shelling the town had suffered, though the
shattered church and a black hole where the
principal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i> once stood were surrounded
by many other evidences of the damage of the
Hun gun-fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have been here through it all," said an
old lady whose French had a heavy Flemish
accent. "We go into the cellars when the
bombardment begins, and when it ends we
come out and go about our work. What else
could we do?"</p>

<p>Some townsfolk had been hit, but none
killed, they said. The merry baker, whose
brown bread had been so greatly enjoyed by
our mess, had been hit by shrapnel bullet a few
weeks before and killed. His wife was running
the bakery still, though in but a small way, she
said, sadly.</p>

<p>The Bois de Ploegsteert and the line in its
vicinity was much the same as when our
Division had left it months before. The wood
was perhaps a little more smashed, the château
a bit more flattened.</p>

<p>Our batteries fired regularly as we walked
about, their shells whirring over our heads without
eliciting a single reply shot from the Huns.</p>

<p>Down the corduroy roads through the Ploegsteert
Wood and to its trench-line, where the
men were far from uncomfortable, the path
seemed sufficiently familiar to have been there
for years instead of months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day, the 27th, my work took me still
further afield. General de Lisle, with General
Briggs and General Mullens and one or two
members of their staffs, were to walk over
the reserve line of trenches from in front of
Kemmel to Dickebusch. One of General Smith-Dorrien's
Staff officers was to accompany them.</p>

<p>Dismounting from the cars at the Station
Inn, on the Neuve Eglise-Kemmel Road, the
party headed for the reserve trenches. I was
instructed to convoy the other cars in the party
to a spot on the Ypres side of Dickebusch.</p>

<p>"Don't stop at the cross-roads," said Captain
Walker of the 2nd Army Staff. "The Germans
shell the cross-roads two or three times every
day. It's best to run up the Vlamertinghe
Road a couple of hundred yards and wait there.
You are not so likely to be hit."</p>

<p>Past Dranoutre and Locre, and thence
through La Clytte and Dickebusch my route
led. Familiar ground of months past, every
inch of it. Here and there fields had been
ploughed well by shell-fire, and many once
familiar buildings along the way had been
shattered or destroyed. It was uncanny to
find that more than one spot which I had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
former days selected as a daily stand for the
car had become a great gaping hole dug by a
huge howitzer shell.</p>

<p>Huts beside the road teemed with
Tommies.</p>

<p>As I entered La Clytte I well remembered
my last day there, in November, 1914. Major
Steele, of the R.A.M.C., and Captain Baron
Le Jeune, a French liaison officer, both of
them popular members of the 1st Cavalry
Division Headquarters Staff, had been killed
in La Clytte by the same shell. Another shell
had that day gone close over General de Lisle
and me as we were leaving the town.</p>

<p>Picking my way past a clumsy farm wagon,
I thought of those days of "close calls." I
was thankful no shells had fallen near me <em>that</em>
morning.</p>

<p>As I drew past the cross-road in La Clytte,
however, a scream sounded over my head, and
a shell burst in the field not one hundred feet
beyond me.</p>

<p>I was off like a flash, abandoning all thought
of saving my car from the rough bumping over
the broken <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i>. It seemed weird, that lone
shell, so close to me in La Clytte. No more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
came, or at least, if they did so, I did not hear
them, and I soon passed Dickebusch.</p>

<p>A two hours' wait in snow and sun and snow
again saw the arrival of General de Lisle, and
we were promptly off for "home."</p>

<p>Such days were fair samples of my work
until March winds had ceased to blow, and
April, with its promise of an early spring, had
come.</p>


    <div class="chapter"></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">On April 1st, I heard at G.H.Q. that
within a few days the French 9th
and 16th Corps, which were in the
Ypres area, were to be moved south. The
British were to take over the line from the
Belgian left near Bixschoote, and make a continuous
British line from that point to the left
of the main French front near the La Bassée
Canal. Events were to happen which prevented
the completion of this plan&mdash;events
due to a German initiative.</p>

<p>The days grew warmer, though rain fell with
sufficient frequency to keep the fields deep with
mud.</p>

<p>Rumours of a "push" could be heard everywhere.
It was timed by most prophets for
April 24th or 25th, though some declared it
would develop by the 20th.</p>

<p>Many there were who scoffed at the idea of
an advance. One story current at G.H.Q.
told of a subaltern of an infantry battalion,
which had long occupied the Ploegsteert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
trenches, who paid a visit to a brother officer
in another division, which had been marooned
in the Kemmel trenches for what had seemed
an interminable period.</p>

<p>"You will notice," said the Kemmel man,
"my men are planting daffodils on the parapets
to hide 'em. We hope to have the line quite
invisible in the course of time."</p>

<p>"Humph," replied he of Ploegsteert, "you
<em>are</em> a lot of blooming optimists. <em>My</em> men have
planted acorns in front of <em>our</em> ditch."</p>

<p>On April 3rd, Lord Kitchener came to
Boulogne by torpedo-boat. On the next
morning, Sunday, he landed, came through
St. Omer, where he was joined by General
French, and proceeded to Chantilly, where a
conference with General Joffre was held. On
the following day, Lord Kitchener and General
French met General Foch at Amiens. A dash
to St. Omer, where Sir John remained, then a
rush to Boulogne, and England's War Minister
was again aboard his torpedo-boat and speeding
back toward Whitehall.</p>

<p>As news of this visit spread over the Army,
rumour piled on rumour of the new "push"
that was to accomplish such great results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>True, sinister minds attributed Kitchener's
visits to the large loss in men and the small
gain in ground of Neuve Chapelle, but they
were greatly in the minority.</p>

<p>We obtained a copy of the <cite>Lille War Gazette</cite>,
a newspaper published by the German Army in
Lille, which contained many items of interest.
Chief among them was an article by a Hun
named Kaden, a lieutenant-colonel of a line
regiment. The following is a translation of
this article, which caused much comment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="pfs120">FIRE.</p>

<p class="center smcap">By Lieutenant-Colonel Kaden.</p>

<p>As children, many of us have played
with it; some of us have seen an outbreak
of fire. First a small tongue-like flame
appears; it grows into a devastating fury
of heat. We out here in the field have
seen more than enough of it.</p>

<p>But there is also the fire of joy&mdash;of
sacred enthusiasm. It arose from sacrificial
altars, from mountain heights of
Germany, and lit up the heavens at the
time of solstice and whenever the home
countries were in danger. This year fires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of joy shall flare from the Bismarck
columns throughout the length and
breadth of Germany, for on April 1st,
just one hundred years ago, our country's
greatest son was born. Let us celebrate
this event in a manner deep, far-reaching,
and mighty!</p>

<p>Blood and Iron!</p>

<p>Let every German, man or woman,
young or old, find in his heart a Bismarck
column, a pillar of fire, now in these
days of storm and stress. Let this fire,
enkindled in every German breast, be a
fire of joy, of holiest enthusiasm. But
let it be terrible, unfettered; let it carry
horror and destruction! Call it hate!
Let no one come to you with "Love
thine enemy!" We all have but one
enemy&mdash;ENGLAND!</p>

<p>How long have we wooed her almost
to the point of our own self-abasement?
She would none of us, so leave to her the
apostles of peace, the "No War" disciples.
The time has passed when we would do
homage to everything English&mdash;our cousins
that were!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"God punish England!"&mdash;"May He
punish her!" This is the greeting that
now passes when Germans meet. The
fire of this righteous hate is all aglow!</p>

<p>You men of Germany from East and
West, forced to shed your blood in the
defence of your homeland, through
England's infamous envy and hatred of
Germany's progress, feed the flame that
burns in your souls. We have but one
War Cry: "God punish England!" Hiss
this one to another in the trenches, in the
charge; hiss as it were the sound of licking
flames. Behold in every dead comrade
a sacrifice forced from you by this accursed
people. Take tenfold vengeance for each
hero's death!</p>

<p>You German people at home, feed this
fire of hate!</p>

<p>You mothers, engrave this in the heart
of the babe at your breast!</p>

<p>You thousands of teachers to whom
millions of German children look up with
eyes and hearts, teach Hate, unquenchable
Hate! You homes of German learning,
pile up the fuel on this fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Tell the nation that this hate is not un-German,
that it is not poison for our
people. Write in letters of fire the name
of our bitterest enemy. You guardians
of the truth, feed this sacred hate!</p>

<p>You German fathers, lead your children
up to the high hills of our homeland, at
the feet of our dear country bathed
in sunshine. Your women and children
shall starve: bestial, devilish conception.
England wills it! Surely all that is in
you rises against such infamy!</p>

<p>Listen to the ceaseless song of the
German forest, behold the fruitful fields
like rolling seas, then will your love for
this wondrous land find the right words,
"Hate, unquenchable Hate! Germany,
Germany above all!"</p>

<p>Let it be inculcated in your children,
and it will grow like a landslide, irresistible,
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>You fathers, proclaim it aloud over the
billowing fields, that the toiling peasant
below may hear you, that the birds of the
forest may fly away with the message:
into the land that echoes from German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
cliffs send it reverberating like the clanging
of bells from tower to tower throughout
the country side:</p>

<p>"Hate, Hate, the accursed English,
Hate!"</p>

<p>You masters, carry the flame to your
workshops. Axe and hammer will fall the
heavier when arms are nerved by this Hate.</p>

<p>You peasants, guard this flame, fan it
anew in the hearts of your toilers that the
hand may rest heavy on the plough that
throws up the soil of our homeland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The Army under Sir John French was
assuming considerable proportions early in
April. In addition to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Divisions, the 27th and
28th, the Canadian Division and the Divisions
of the Indian Corps, as well as the 1st, 2nd
and 3rd Cavalry Divisions and the Indian
Cavalry Division, were well seasoned. The
North Midland, 2nd London and South Midland
Territorial Divisions were "out," and fast
gaining experience and a good reputation with
it, while the Northumberland Territorial Division
was on the way.</p>

<p>G.H.Q. information summaries in the early
days of April said laconically, "Nothing to
report on the British front," and were generally
fairly correct.</p>

<p>On the 8th and 9th the roads leading from
the Ypres district were filled with French
troops moving southward. The veterans of
the 9th Corps limped past, frost-bite having
visited most of them during their long sojourn
in the trenches of the Salient.</p>

<p>Lines of French guns ambled by, "75's,"
with their graceful light grey lines, were
eminently business-like, their gunners clad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dark blue cape-overcoats that looked warm and
comfortable.</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division was given a new
brigade, the 9th, which consisted of the 15th
Hussars, 19th Lancers and the Warwickshire
Territorial Battery.</p>

<p>Bumping over the bad roads at good speed
meant frequent car trouble. I was fortunate to
find Harold Smith, the Royal Automobile Club
Engineer, one day at Boulogne, where he was
superintending the installation of a first-class
motor repair plant for the Red Cross Ambulances.
Mieville, of the Red Cross, in whose
hands were all matters pertaining to Red Cross
motor vehicles, proved a good Samaritan.
Between Mieville and Smith my decrepit car
was given a new lease of life.</p>

<p>The Army Service Corps would have done
well to have "co-opted" Smith and one or two
more like him. His repair shop at Boulogne,
when completed, was so far ahead of any repair
park possessed by the Army in France that
comparison made the Army shops look very
bad indeed. Yet Smith's work was done in
three weeks or less and a building of quite a
temporary character utilised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>While I was in Boulogne an Army Service
Corps captain came to Harold Smith and said:
"I have been told to lay down a foundry, and
unfortunately know nothing whatever about the
bally thing. Do you happen to know anything
about a foundry?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Smith, "have a fairly
good idea of what you will need. Suppose I
draw up a specification of a foundry installation
to-night and let you have it to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Delighted," said the captain. "It would
be good of you."</p>

<p>So Smith set to work, duly completed the
specification, and turned it over to the A.S.C.
man, who went away, quite happy, at once to
put in the specification as it was handed to
him. He admittedly had no knowledge as to its
correctness and was quite satisfied to seek none.</p>

<p>I met Moore-Brabazon, of the Flying Corps,
on the quay. With a few days' leave in his
pocket, he was as happy as a sandboy.</p>

<p>"We had a chap rejoin us a day or so ago,"
said "Brab," "who had a remarkable story to
tell. His name is Mapplebeck. He is an
officer in the Liverpool Regiment, attached to
the R.F.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not long ago, Mapplebeck was up alone
on a scout near Lille, when his engine went
wrong, and he had to make a descent. He
knew he was well inside the German lines, but
was shocked to see a couple of Huns, apparently
doing sentry duty, not far from where he had
planned to land.</p>

<p>"The two Germans ran toward the machine
as it came down, each grabbing hold of the
left wing. The biplane tossed and rolled and
pitched about as it came to rest. Mapplebeck
tumbled out on the right side, dived head first
through a thick hedge a few feet distant, and
ran hot-foot down a deep ditch that led to a
cross-hedge not far away.</p>

<p>"He lost no time in dodging through the
further hedge, and was off like a hare down
another ditch. The Huns must have taken
the wrong turning when pursuing him, as he
got clear away and hid in a dwelling till night.</p>

<p>"Obtaining some peasant clothing, Mapplebeck
made his way into Lille. Though the
town was full of Germans, his disguise was so
good he was not bothered in any way. Finding
a loyal French business man, Mapplebeck
cashed a London cheque, for which he received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
French notes bearing a German stamp. With
these he bought a suit of clothing, and started
to tramp the road to Belgium.</p>

<p>"He reached Belgium safely, kept on, and
eventually crossed the Dutch border. Obtaining
passage to London, he at once went to
Farnborough and reported. There he was
given a new machine which was ready to come
to France. He lost no time in bringing it
across the channel and reporting for duty, just
as though nothing unusual had happened.</p>

<p>"One by one we obtained from him the
details of his experiences. He was mightily
modest about it all, and laughed at the idea
that he had done anything that was the least
bit out of the ordinary."</p>

<p>On April 17th the 2nd Cavalry Division held
a horse show at Vieux Berquin. The horses
and the riding were worthy of the best that
Dublin or Olympia could produce.</p>

<p>Sunday, the 18th, I had set aside for a joy-ride.
Running to St. Omer, I picked up
Major St. Leger, of the Irish Guards, Assistant
Camp Commandant, and then called at a farm
near Meteren, where the 9th Lancers' Headquarters
were billeted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Beale-Browne, "Bimbo" Reynolds, Rex
Benson and Alex Graham, were out enjoying
the perfect morning, but we luckily found
Captain "Algy" Court, of the 9th, who had
been in the hospital when the Brigade was at
Ypres, and thus missed seeing the Salient.
This made him the more keen to have a look
at the famous Menin Road. Calling at General
Mullens's headquarters at Godawaersvelde, in
the hope of annexing "Rattle" Barrett,
"Jeff" Hornby or Romer Williams, but
finding the Brigade Staff absent to a man,
we pushed on to Poperinghe, where we procured
a very passable luncheon in a crowded
hotel.</p>

<p>Finally we reached Ypres, ran through it,
and out on the Menin Road toward Hooge.
Court was very anxious to run on to Hooge,
but I had been told a car could be seen by the
Huns as it approached that delectable spot,
and I therefore counselled discretion. "Algy"
pressed hard for a visit to Hooge itself, saying
he was most eager to inspect the "trenches
to the south of the road." St. Leger wavered,
but finally agreed with me that to "run into
one" when joy-riding would look bad, so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
satisfied ourselves with watching the bursting
shells from a safe distance.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks later, "Algy" Court was
killed in those very trenches to the south of
the Menin Road at Hooge, when the 9th
Lancers, badly gassed and heavily attacked
on front and left flank&mdash;all but outflanked, in
fact&mdash;held on gallantly during a day of the
fiercest of fighting, and saved the line.</p>

<p>While we were on Menin Road little groups
of wounded Tommies came past. A Canadian
Staff officer told us the K.O.S.B.'s, and the
West Kents had rushed a German position on
a hill in front of Zillebeke, after our engineers
had exploded a mine under it. About 200
yards of enemy trench had been taken, and
fifteen prisoners, including two officers, captured.
From them it was learned that at least 150
Huns, most of whom must have been killed,
were in the destroyed trench.</p>

<p>"The K.O.S.B.'s and the West Kents," said
the Canadian, "are hanging on to the captured
area, in spite of continual heavy counter-attacks
by the Germans. We had just had a message
from our chaps asking for help to hold on."</p>

<p>As he spoke a roar burst forth on the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not far away, seeming to me to come from a
point just south of Cavan's House. For
fifteen minutes Hun howitzer shells fell in
scores on the luckless area of the successful
advance. The air reverberated with the
crashes of the huge shells, which fell in such
rapid succession one could not count them.</p>

<p>After we left Ypres, we heard still another
fierce deluge of shell-fire fall on that spot late
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Such was the commencement of the fight for
Hill 60, near Verbranden Molen, which was to
be contested bitterly for many a day, costing
thousands of casualties to friend and foe. The
next day, the 19th, the Germans tried to win
back the position at the point of the bayonet,
and succeeded in gaining a foot-hold on the
southern slope of the hill, only to lose it after
a hand to hand fight that afternoon.</p>

<p>The Huns also gave Ypres and the Menin
Road a heavy shelling for an hour on the 19th,
just twenty-four hours too late to catch our
"joy party." The day of our visit was the last
one that found the Menin Road a safe place,
for daily thereafter the 17-inch shells were busy
with the terrible work that was to end in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
utter devastation of Ypres&mdash;work which was to
continue for the rest of April, through May,
and well into June, with but little respite.</p>

<p>A couple of days later the West Surreys had
a fight for Hill 60 that nearly swept away the
battalion. The Germans brought up some
field guns and hammered away at our parapets
at close range. When the West Surreys came
out, after gallantly holding the position until relieved,
a subaltern was the senior officer left in
command. The "Princess Pat's," too, were to
leave the majority of their officers there. Hill 60
took toll of all but a remnant of that regiment.</p>

<p>We dropped "Algy" Court at his billets, then
hastened to St. Omer, where a good dinner
was awaiting us. St. Leger's mess was always a
cheery one, having among its members Surgeon-General
O'Donnell, Colonel Cummings, of the
R.A.M.C., Colonel Warren, of the Army Post
Office, and Colonel Thresher, the Camp Commandant.
That night Colonel Father Keating
and Captain Father Rawlinson were fellow-guests,
two greatly beloved "Padres," in either
of whom was sufficient subtle merriment and
quiet humour to cheer up a whole corps of
pessimists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>A captured German order gave rather gruesome
details of a liquid-fire thrower of sorts,
intended, so the order said, for fighting in
streets and houses.</p>

<p>The German official report accused the
British at Hill 60 of using shells containing
poisonous fumes.</p>

<p>Odd forerunners, these, in the light of subsequent
events, for on Friday, April 23rd,
came the first German gas attack.</p>

<p>The 23rd dawned bright and clear, a perfect
spring morning. Soon after daybreak word
came that the Germans had broken the French
line between Bixschoote and Langemarck.
The 1st Cavalry Division was ordered to
concentrate between Ecke and Godawaersvelde,
preparatory to being sent up in support.</p>

<p>The Germans had sprung their first gas
attack in the grey of dawn, launching the
asphyxiating fumes at a portion of the allied
line held by the 78th French Reservist Division.</p>

<p>The success of the new manœuvre had been
extraordinary. That it far exceeded the most
sanguine hopes of the Germans was clear from
the fact that very few troops were available to
take advantage of so great a hole in the allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
line. No German cavalry was sufficiently near
at hand to be utilised. That this point was
brought well home to the Huns was made
clear to us within very few hours afterward, for
before the second gas attack the Germans had
moved up a couple of corps of cavalry to a
point within call.</p>

<p>But the opportunity had passed. Gas, when
its use was unexpected, its effect multiplied by
ignorance as to what it really was, and vague
conjecture as to what it might be, and gas
when our troops were expecting it and had
been warned as to its objects and dangers,
were very different propositions.</p>

<p>That the German gas attacks were for some
time most demoralising, and often locally
successful, was not to be denied; but some part
of the line invariably held, and made the local
enemy gain of less importance. Respirators
assisted men to stay in their trenches in spite of
the coming of the noxious fumes. Of far more
value was the gradual realisation on the part of
the men that gas could be withstood, and might
or might not envelope them in sufficient
quantity to produce a deadly effect.</p>

<p>Those French reservists who first were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
wrapped in the strange greenish-yellow mist
that left them gasping for air and dying of
strangulation, were not to be too greatly condemned
for the general scamper that ensued.
Under the circumstances, the indefinable and
inexplicable horror would very likely have torn
the line from the grasp of the most seasoned
troops of either the French or British armies.
Later I saw battalions of English veterans
in utter demoralization by the coming of the
gas, and it was many a day before the sight of
a gas cloud failed to bring great terror to many
a soldier who had to face it.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock on the morning of the 23rd
the situation seemed most serious. Back from
the Bixschoote-Langemarck line the French
had come to the line of the canal that leads
south from Steenstraate to Ypres. At a point
not far from Boesinghe the Huns had actually
crossed to the west bank of the canal, were at
the very doors of Boesinghe, and had taken
Het-Sas and Lizerne to the north. Lizerne
was well to the west of the canal, and on the
main Dixmude-Ypres road.</p>

<p>Messages that reached the 1st Cavalry Division,
explaining the situation, were addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to the Cavalry Corps, Indian Cavalry, 2nd
Army, and the new Northumbrian Territorial
Division. All these units were to be engaged
on that front before many days had passed.</p>

<p>General De Lisle ran to 5th Corps Headquarters
in Poperinghe before eleven o'clock.
We passed battalion after battalion of the North
Country Terriers along the road, trudging
sturdily Ypreswards, or lying in the fields for a
breather.</p>

<p>Ambulances were continually arriving in
Poperinghe, full of wounded and gassed
Tommies.</p>

<p>I met Major Moore, of the Canadian Division,
who told me the Canadians had been "at it
hard." Another Canadian acquaintance, a
wounded officer, came past, and told me something
of the situation.</p>

<p>The Canadians had won laurels that morning
by an action which showed clearly the great
military value of individual initiative in the
private soldier. That is the quality that made
British generals think the Australian and
New Zealand soldiers who were lost at the
Dardanelles the finest men that had yet been
produced in the great world-war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>In dug-outs in front of Wieltje and west
of St. Julien, some of the Canadians were
unaware of the gas attack until the Germans
had driven the French well back and come on
after them to such close quarters that the grey
lines were clearly visible to the surprised
Canadian eyes.</p>

<p>Grabbing rifles and ammunition pouches,
with no time for company or battalion formation,
officers and men rushed toward the
advancing lines of Huns, and seeking such cover
as could be found, opened a fierce fire at short
range. The natural, inborn individual fighting
spirit of men raised in the open&mdash;men to whose
hands a rifle was no stranger&mdash;met the situation
with such instinctive cohesion of action that
the Huns were driven back and the line saved.</p>

<p>A 5th Corps Staff officer told us the
Canadians had actually saved the day and
had established, during the early hours of the
morning, a crescent-shaped line from the Canal
south-east of Boesinghe to a point just north
of St. Julien, the crescent bending southward
as the line crossed the Ypres-Langemarck
road. From this line they were gradually
being forced south by heavy German attacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>From one to two o'clock our Divisional
Headquarters waited by the roadside in the
western edge of Poperinghe while our three
brigades came up, preparatory to a move
toward the scene of battle.</p>

<p>That hour of inaction was crammed with
scenes that told of the heavy fighting ahead
of us. Lyne-Stephens, convoying a couple
of dozen of the splendid Du Cros ambulances,
full to overflowing with shattered men, hurried
past <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Hazebrouck. As a hospital
train of twelve coaches, every available corner
containing a wounded Tommy, steamed west,
scores of motor omnibuses hurried eastward
toward the sound of the guns, every khaki-coloured
'bus with its complement of the
Lancashire and Yorkshire Terriers of the
North Midland Division. Refugees laden
with cardboard boxes, pushing loaded bicycles
or pulling-carts groaning under tall piles of
household effects, added to the road's congestion.
Detachments of infantry marching
on, guns rattling up, ammunition trains urging
their claims to special facilities for a clear road,
added to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>Over this highway, jammed with two lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of traffic bound in each direction, the 1st Cavalry
Division and its transport pushed its way,
through Poperinghe, where railway trains were
debouching long lines of blue-clad French
regulars, and then on along the road toward
Elverdinghe, to the eastward.</p>

<p>General de Lisle went first to Woesten,
which we found full of French territorial troops.
Shells had fallen in the village during the
morning, but none were bursting near when
we arrived.</p>

<p>We started down the road toward Elverdinghe
but had not gone far when Bang! bang! just
in front, then the whirr of shrapnel bullets, the
sharp crack as they struck the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i> a few yards
ahead, and spurts of dirt and dust, told us that
the roadway was receiving attention at the
hands of the Boche gunners.</p>

<p>I pulled the car up sharply, and as I did so
two more shrapnel burst a few feet above the
road in front of us, the missiles from the
exploding shells singing past and striking all
about with nasty smacks, as if in boasting
evidence of a creditable amount of velocity
and precision.</p>

<p>One regiment of our Division was assigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
duty as a reserve for the Belgian left, which
was not far north of us. Another regiment
was to act as reserve for the French in front
of us. The remainder of the Division was a
sort of general reserve, to be utilised wherever
and whenever necessity arose.</p>

<p>A run to Elverdinghe showed that it had
been heavily shelled, the church being riddled
with great holes. Our line was pushed to the
east of the town. An ambulance driver who
had been left in Elverdinghe told me he was
sure "someone will get it in this hole soon,"
and he proved to be no bad prophet.</p>

<p>As dark closed we learned that the Canadians'
line had been forced back, but the support line
had held firm as a rock, and our men were
counter-attacking most gallantly as the day
ended. The rumph! rumph! of the howitzer
shells increased in frequency, the cannonade
swelling in volume as the night came.</p>

<p>A good sized château between Poperinghe
and Elverdinghe housed our Headquarters Staff
for the night.</p>

<p>A run to Cassel at daybreak was a maddening
experience, the road from Steenvoorde to
Poperinghe being packed and jammed with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
manner of horse and motor transport. A big
five-ton lorry belonging to the Canadians had
broken down as it was being turned in the
narrow roadway. Result, an immovable barrier
across the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i>.</p>

<p>If ever in my life I longed to tamper with a
job that was "none of my business," I did so
on that 24th of April. Organisation of the
traffic on that congested road could have been
so easily done with a dozen assistants, and
hours saved to all users of the road.</p>

<p>Thousands of light French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camions</i> were
waiting at Cassel for train-load after train-load
of French troops from Arras. The 9th Corps,
which had so few days previously left Ypres,
after a sojourn of there of many months, was
being hurried back as fast as steam and petrol
could bring it.</p>

<p>That morning I was given a message for
General de Lisle from the French Corps
Commander, to the effect that the British
Cavalry was required in the front line.</p>

<p>Temporary divisional headquarters had been
established at the fourth kilometre stone on the
Elverdinghe road, to allow messages from
regiments or brigades easily to find it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>When I arrived with the message I transmitted
it to Major Fitzgerald, then set off to
seek de Lisle, who, "Fitz" said, was making a
tour of the line, and could be found either in
Woesten or Elverdinghe.</p>

<p>I chose the latter objective. The way was
lined by great black French Spahis, clad in
variegated garb and wondrous head gear, for
the first couple of kilometres. As we approached
Elverdinghe, all signs of life vanished. An
odd stillness brooded over the immediate
vicinity, a sort of local lull in the maelstrom of
sound the shell-bursts were making and had
made throughout the night, a couple of miles
to the eastward.</p>

<p>A half instinctive pause in the edge of the
village, and a moment spent in tense listening,
gave me an uncanny feeling of solitude. As I
stood, undecided whether to push on into the
town or circle back for Woesten, the silence
was mashed to reverberating atoms by an 8-in.
howitzer shell, which fell not far from the town.</p>

<p>Bang! rumph! r-r-r-rumph! Bang!
Shrapnel and high explosive seemed to come
together.</p>

<p>Another and another shell followed, then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
blinding crash as I was turning my car and a
shell burst in the square not far away, showering
bits of shell and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> over me.</p>

<p>The pieces slap-slapped resoundingly against
the metal panels of the car, and one good-sized
stone was hurled against my back.</p>

<p>As I raced away to safety towards Poperinghe,
the shells still came into the village and around it,
and followed the road at my back, urging me on.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I saw Captain Bertram
Neame, the Adjutant of the 18th Hussars, who
had been wounded in the right hand and arm
by one of the shells.</p>

<p>"An aeroplane marked with red, white and
blue rings, but evidently a German flying false
colours, circled round over the battery near
us," said Neame, "and half a dozen German
shrapnel fell there at once. Then the 'plane
circled over the farm containing 18th Headquarters,
and another farm which was sheltering
most of A Squadron. Immediately afterwards
shells poured into the two farms, and several
of the men were hit."</p>

<p>Months after I read the diary of Captain T.
O. Thompson, of the R.A.M.C., who was
attached to the 18th Hussars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His graphic account of the shelling in Elverdinghe
that morning read as follows: "A
Squadron were in the next farm, and all their
men sleeping peacefully in the sunshine against
the wall of a barn, when, without warning, a
'coalbox' arrived and landed full on one man.
They found only an arm and a leg and his
head. The next arrived later and wounded
two men. The inhabitants of the farm cleared
at a run, and some French territorials, who had
been in that farm for seven months, went like
greased lightning.</p>

<p>"The Colonel (Burnett), and Adjutant
(Neame), and Captain H. (Holdsworth),
walked about thirty yards up the road, when a
shell arrived and wounded the Adjutant in the
hand and H. in the back. It hit the Colonel on
the back, fortunately on the belt, and slightly
wounded him in the thigh. It bruised the
Major, who was twenty yards away, on the shin.</p>

<p>"The Germans kept on putting shells along
the road, and then started on the village.
They were the beastly 8·2 high explosives,
and were going just over us on to the Poperinghe
road. Six horses were going up this
road when a shell landed about fifteen yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
short of it. One of the grooms was badly
wounded, one killed, being lifted into and left
hanging in one of the trees by the roadside.</p>

<p>"Then the 4th Dragoon Guards came down
the road on foot and passed into the village,
but came out again as a shell greeted them in
the square. They came off the road, and came
along a hollow near the stream toward us.
The rear squadron was marching along a ditch
behind a hedge-row in two-deep formation
when a beastly shell landed right in the ditch
and hurled four of them sixty feet into the air.
Two others were killed as well. Brown, a 4th
D.G. Lieutenant, was one of the four; his hand
was found in the stream one hundred and fifty
yards away."</p>
</div>

<p>All things considered, I was lucky to get out
of Elverdinghe unhurt that morning.</p>

<p>I found General de Lisle as he was returning
from Woesten with Captain Nicholson; I then
ran to Woesten with a message for General
Briggs.</p>

<p>General de Lisle was faced with the fact that
he was acting as reserve to the British left, and
therefore suggested to the French commander
that the French reserves should first be used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and the British cavalry only called upon to
occupy the front French line when no further
French reserves were available, a suggestion of
which the French General at once saw the
wisdom.</p>

<p>Returning from Woesten, Nicholson and I
found we must make a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</i>, as the narrow
country road was completely blocked by French
horse transport.</p>

<p>Dashing into Poperinghe at high speed we
were surprised to see the townsfolk running
hither and thither in great fright and confusion.
Six great shells had been thrown the long
distance from the enemy line and landed in the
town. They had come but a couple of minutes
before, a scared Belgian told us.</p>

<p>I lost no time, swinging through the square
and out on the Elverdinghe road at high speed.
No sooner were we clear of the centre of the
town than Hun shells screamed wickedly over
us on their way toward the railway station,
exploding not far behind us with tremendous
concussion. Guns of large calibre were being
used by the Germans.</p>

<p>First Cavalry Division Headquarters was
moved from the kilometre stone to an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>near by, as the inhabitants had brought up two
great wagons and decamped therein with bag
and baggage.</p>

<p>Tales of Canadian prowess and fine work by
the 13th Infantry Brigade, which was sent to
their support, were mingled with conflicting
reports of the number of guns captured by the
Germans. First, the loss of a couple of dozen
was admitted by the French. Before a week
had passed we knew the number actually taken
by the Germans was much greater.</p>

<p>Ypres, we heard, had been so heavily shelled
the day before that the entire town had been
evacuated.</p>

<p>All the morning I watched ambulances full
of wounded French soldiers <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for
Poperinghe, file past war-worn batteries of
"75's," pushing toward the front. The begrimed
French gunners, with their cheery
faces, seemed to know the esteem in which
we held them and their splendid guns, and
to be keen to get into action and stem the
advance of the Germans, which was slowly
but steadily surging towards us though our men
were fighting hard every inch of the way.</p>

<p>The Belgian refugees poured back, forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
off the road by the lorries, ambulances and
guns. Slight mothers with numerous progeny,
one, or sometimes two, of the lesser units in
arms, toiled by. Each person, young or old,
capable of carrying a load, bore heavy burdens.
Bicycles with huge bundles balanced on the
saddle, were pushed westward haltingly, as
road-space permitted. One lad passed on
crutches, flanked by two grand-dames carrying
blue buckets crammed tight with portions of
the family wardrobe.</p>

<p>Most of the faces of the refugees bore a
stolid, matter-of-fact expression. Some were
quite cheerful. Many seemed stoically numbed
to all feeling. The strong wind tossed their
unwieldy bundles, and they stumbled awkwardly
out of the path of hurrying traffic,
their feet bruised against the loose stones that
edged the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i>. Tired, dirty, buffeted by the
gale, with strained and aching muscles and
broken feet, fleeing from death or worse, and
in their flight abandoning their worldly all, I
wondered there were not more signs of heart-sickness
and despair on their thin faces.</p>

<p>Shells screamed over us and ploughed great
holes in the British aviation park east of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Poperinghe. After the first half dozen of such
visitors, the Flying Corps packed up and took
its departure for safer quarters.</p>

<p>A wounded Canadian said the 2nd and 3rd
Canadian Brigades in front of us were wiped
out as a fighting force. Their trenches, he
told us had been literally blown to bits. A
counter-attack by the Canadians, the 13th
Brigade and the French 45th Division on their
left, had started well, but failed to achieve
much. German batteries and machine guns
greatly outnumbered ours and were taking
heavy toll as the battle surged backwards and
forwards.</p>

<p>Before the day was over the French reported
that they had recaptured Lizerne.</p>

<p>Night closed with an increasing din from the
arms of all sorts and calibres on our front,
never to cease for the whole night through.</p>

<p>I was sent after dark to G.H.Q. at St. Omer,
a journey that meant many a long hour of
tedious waiting in the midst of the tangled
skein of traffic along the way.</p>

<p>Returning at daybreak on Sunday, the 25th,
I planned a round-about route from Steenvoorde
to Poperinghe, circling well north of the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
road. I had travelled but a few kilometres
when I found the narrow, muddy road in front
of me completely blocked by a train of French
lorries, laden with troops. Some of the vehicles
were mired, and the block bid fair to be
immovable for hours. By sheer luck I stopped
opposite a farmyard, in which I turned the car,
and not far back gained a cross-road. A
mile beyond the route was rendered absolutely
impassable by two detachments of British
transport, which had met face to face on a
road barely wide enough for one.</p>

<p>"We have been here a divil of a toime,"
said a cheery Irish driver at the rear of the
column, "and from the look of it beyant there,
we'll be slapin' here in the mud this night."</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, I turned, pushed by
willing hands when deep mud made assistance
necessary, and headed the other way. But
fate was unkind. Again I found the road
barricaded, this time by two signal lorries that
had, like me, tried a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</i>. One had skidded
sideways and stuck fast. The other was trying
to pull his fellow back on to the roadway.
Disheartened, I soon tired of what threatened
to be a long wait, and returned toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Steenvoorde. A new convoy of French troop-lorries
closed this avenue of escape, but after
an hour of floundering through almost impassable
lanes, I reached Abele, on the main road,
and was soon thereafter in Poperinghe.</p>

<p>Truly an ounce of prevention in the way of
road organisation and route selection by some
competent authority would have been worth
many pounds of the condemnation poured forth
with volubility by all road users in those days
of tiresome traffic tangles.</p>

<p>Our headquarters moved to an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i>
just outside Woesten.</p>

<p>I learned, on arrival, that at midnight word
had come from the French Commander, General
Putz, whose headquarters were but a few
hundred yards distant, to the effect that a
mistake had been made in a previous report,
and Lizerne was still in the hands of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The roads were filled with French troops
moving up, and relieved reservists coming
back, while battery on battery of grey "75's"
wheeled past.</p>

<p>"I don't know where they are going to put
any <em>more</em> guns," said Budworth, our Divisional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
C.R.A., "the whole country round is stiff
with 'em now."</p>

<p>Fresson, the French liaison officer attached
to the 1st Cavalry Division, sought at French
headquarters an explanation of the situation on
the extreme French left, where the Belgian
right joined it.</p>

<p>"Lizerne was attacked by French and
Belgians, and Pilkem by French only," said
Fresson, on his return. "The mix-up in the
report was due to the Belgians. The story
of Lizerne is indefinite, except that the Germans
were not driven out, as reported. As to the
Pilkem attack, this failed utterly, due to wire,
machine-guns, and general concentration by
the enemy of the position they had captured.</p>

<p>"A further attack," continued Fresson, "is
to be made this morning at 10.30., when the
Pilkem ridge is to be again stormed."</p>

<p>The Pilkem ridge was east of our part of
the front, not far distant from the canal itself.
The sounds of battle from the line facing it
were continually in our ears.</p>

<p>General Smith-Dorrien drove by. One of
his Staff told me that at ten o'clock on the
night before (Saturday night) 200 Canadians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
were still in St. Julien, though the line had
been pressed back, leaving the little band cut
off and surrounded by Germans. All night
they had fought on, and were still fighting.</p>

<p>Some of our men had gotten up sufficiently
close to hear the Huns call out to the gallant
Canadians in a lull in the firing: "Surrender,
Canadians! We are around you! You have
no chance!"</p>

<p>"See you damned first! Come and get us,"
was the answer sent back in the night by a
clear young Canadian voice, and Bedlam was
again let loose.</p>

<p>That was the spirit of the men that Canada
sent to France to fight for the Empire.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning, said the Staff officer,
a determined effort was being made to relieve
what remained of the gallant 200.</p>

<p>All our attacks that day and those of the
French as well failed. Lizerne remained in
enemy hands, and the last of the heroic two
hundred Canadians had evidently fallen in
St. Julien before night, for all sounds of firing
from that direction ceased. Strive as they
would, our troops had been unable to reach
and succour them, though costly efforts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
not wanting. Weeks and months afterwards
anxious ones waited for word from some of
that noble little band in St. Julien, but no word
ever came from German hospital or prison
camp. They had fought on to the last man,
to the bitter end!</p>

<p>At night the Germans attacked Broodseinde,
east of Zonnebeke, with great ferocity, but
were driven back by our 5th Corps troops.</p>

<p>What was left of the Canadian 2nd Brigade
was holding Gravenstafel, just north of Zonnebeke,
and not far to the south-west of Passchendaele.
The Huns poured mass on mass
against the depleted ranks of the Canadians,
who were compelled to fall back, evacuating
Gravenstafel, but stubbornly disputing every
foot of ground lost.</p>

<p>The night of Sunday, the 25th, closed in,
with little in the situation to cheer us, except
the knowledge that the entire vicinity of the
Ypres Salient and the line to the north of it
was crowded with fresh French and British
troops and battery on battery of guns.</p>

<p>By Monday night the London Sunday papers
had reached us.</p>

<p>What was our surprise to see that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
London press was greatly cheered by the
meagre French and British official reports,
and united in condemning the German official
reports, which were flatly characterised as lying
inventions.</p>

<p>The German official reports were, as a matter
of fact, in that particular instance, more correct
than either the French or British official reports.</p>

<p>The French report declared Lizerne and Het-Sas
to have been taken from the Huns. The
Huns had never been driven out of either town.</p>

<p>The British report was vaguely optimistic,
evidently bent on minimising the German
gains. It was so worded that 999 men
out of 1,000 would understand from it that
most of the ground lost on the 23rd and the
days immediately following had been won back
from the enemy. Certain it was that no one
would gain the idea from the British official
report that the Huns had been steadily forcing
our line back, that our counter-attacks had
failed, and that the Ypres Salient was then so
threatened that no one but a madman would
deny that further reconstruction of our line
around Ypres, involving the giving up of a
large section of our front line had become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
military necessity, to be performed at the
earliest moment such a manœuvre could be
carried out. Indeed, the section of our line to
be abandoned must needs be far greater than
that the enemy had won by his surprise gas
attack against the French.</p>

<p>I do not wish to give the impression from
the foregoing that the German reports were, as
a rule, more correct than French or British
official <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pronunciamientos</i>. I think they were
by no means so to be described. In matters of
fact, as to captures of men or guns, or details
as to bits of line lost or won, the Hun official
reports were less often incorrect than some
might think. Now and then, when dealing
with some matter of conjecture, such as an
estimate of our casualties, they were absurdly
wide of the mark. The average French official
report might err slightly as regarded detail, but
was in the main most dependable. Our chief
quarrel with the official reports as issued by
the War Office to the British Press was that
they were at times subject to more than one
interpretation. Escaping actual inaccuracy,
they did not always convey the impression at
Home warranted by the facts at the Front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th I ran toward
Wieltje, and obtained details of the exact
position of the lines.</p>

<p>The French left touched the Belgian right
along the Yser-Ypres Canal north of Lizerne,
where the German line was pushed to its
further western point. The French line ran close
to Het-Sas and crossed to the east of the canal
a few hundred yards south of Boesinghe.</p>

<p>At a point a couple of thousand yards east
of the canal the British left joined the extreme
French right.</p>

<p>From that junction our line ran eastward
through Fortuin, a village half a mile south
of St. Julien, then north-east toward Gravenstafel,
then south-east to Broodseinde.</p>

<p>At two o'clock that afternoon a grand attack
was planned, all along that east-and-west line.</p>

<p>The 13th Brigade was on the left; two
companies of the Rifle Brigade and the East
Kents came next; five battalions of the
10th Brigade and a battalion in reserve
were near Fortuin; on their right was the
11th Brigade; east of them were the York
and Durham Territorial Brigades. The
Northumbrian Territorial Division was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Wieltje area in reserve, and the Lahore Division
was coming up to the north of Verlorenhoek,
on the right of the Northumberland
Terriers.</p>

<p>Our forces, to be sent forward in attack,
numbered over two score battalions, say,
40,000 men.</p>

<p>The Canadians had been withdrawn from
the Salient to take stock of their battered
remnants and fill their ranks with reserves
from England. They had been tried in the
fire and could be proud of having gained the
name of one of the most brilliant fighting contingents
that had been seen on the British front
since the commencement of the War.</p>

<p>The French were again to attack the Pilkem
ridge at two o'clock, when the British line,
between four and five miles long, was to push
vigorously northward in a desperate attempt
to drive the Huns from the ground gained by
gas attack three days before.</p>

<p>Our share in the show was small. The
following order was issued to the brigades:</p>

<p>"At two p.m. to-day the French will attack
Lizerne and Het-Sas. The 1st Cavalry Division
are ordered to support the left flank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the French, acting in reserve. The Division
will be saddled up by two p.m. and the horses
of the 1st Cavalry Brigade collected in the
area south-west of Woesten. By two p.m.
the 1st Cavalry Brigade will assemble, dismounted,
north of the Woesten-Oostoleteren
road, about the nineteenth kilometre stone,
ready to support in the direction of Pypegaale,
if required. The 2nd and 9th Brigades will
remain in their present positions, ready to
support the 1st Cavalry Brigade dismounted."</p>

<p>This gave vague promise of a bit of fun, as
Pypegaale was only a mile from the coveted
Lizerne, to which the Huns were holding so
doggedly.</p>

<p>But our participation in the mill was only
to take place in the event of the French attack
ending in disaster or resulting in such extraordinary
success that the Germans would be
put to absolute rout.</p>

<p>The shells fell all about in those days, and
rarely did I visit the support positions&mdash;which
I did scores of times each day&mdash;when the air
was not full of the droning shells of our own
and the French batteries, pounding the enemy's
positions on the canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Shell-fire; aeroplanes, British, French and
German; anti-aircraft shells, both ours and
those of the enemy, and passing troops and
batteries became such common sights as the
hours went by that one hardly bestowed on
them a passing glance.</p>

<p>A Belgian woman was caught, near a battery
position, flashing signals with a piece of bright
tin to a Hun airman high overhead. The
French took her away, one stout soldier to
each arm, to summary execution.</p>

<p>Children were at play at the roadside. A
dozen boys were engaged in a mock bombardment.
A bottle served as the hostile town.
Stones made good shells. All waited for the
order, "Fire!" and then rained shots at the
target with a will. Now and then one of the
children would say, "Rumph! rumph!" mockingly,
as a Black Maria fell near enough to jar
them, but for the most part they paid scant
attention to the fierce cannonade in progress
all about.</p>

<p>In a field by the road a man was ploughing
stolidly. A woman was hanging her washing
on the line, singing as she worked. A 13-pounder
anti-aircraft shell buried itself a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
yards away, but she evinced no interest in it,
and did not even allow its coming to interrupt
her song.</p>

<p>Artillery work in modern warfare is carefully
organised. It was difficult to realise in the
midst of such an inferno of shell-fire that every
gunner, who was so hard at work in those
April days, had some definite objective when
launching shells enemy-ward.</p>

<p>Major Budworth was directed to conduct the
artillery attack on Lizerne. In other words,
the guns of H and I Batteries of the Royal
Horse Artillery were to pave the way for the
French infantry attack.</p>

<p>General Putz was anxious to retake Lizerne
and Steenstraate as well. The latter town was
on the canal, a few hundred yards east of
Lizerne, and astride the Dixmude-Ypres
highway, along which German reserves, to
meet the attack on Lizerne, must be brought.</p>

<p>Budworth placed the batteries near Woesten,
about 3,000 yards from Lizerne, which was
surrounded by country so flat and so dotted
with groups of trees that artillery observation
was difficult.</p>

<p>A couple of gunners were sent into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
French front trenches at 11.30 a.m. to observe
the range-finding shots.</p>

<p>The Lizerne attack had been timed for
2.30 p.m. All watches had been most carefully
synchronized. At 12.15 p.m., to the very
second, H Battery fired three shots, then, after
an interval, three shots more. Five minutes
after the second trio had been sent Hun-ward,
I Battery also fired six shots in groups of three.
The observation officers on reconnaissance
'phoned back to the batteries from the French
line, and gave minute details as to errors in
range of the dozen shells, adding such information
as would allow a more correct setting of
the timing-fuses.</p>

<p>Errors in direction at such range&mdash;3,000 to
4,000 yards make an ideal range for the British
13-pounder and 18-pounder field-guns&mdash;were
rare, in view of the fact that our gunners
were provided with accurate large scale maps
from which the range could be splendidly laid.</p>

<p>To get the guns closer to the enemy than
3,000 yards made it possible that the gunners
might be subjected to hostile rifle fire, if the
line should be forced back slightly. At such
close range as 2,000 yards so low a trajectory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was necessary that cover was rarely possible.
Further, the supplying of ammunition to the
guns was, under such circumstances, a most
difficult problem. If an artillery commander
could place his field-guns within 3,000 yards
of the enemy position he considered himself
fortunate.</p>

<p>Budworth was compelled to use shrapnel, as
the 13-pounders at the Front at that time had
not been provided with high explosive shell,
although it had been repeatedly promised.
Had high explosive shell been available, one
battery would have sent it hurtling against the
walls and houses in the little village of Lizerne
and the Germans hiding behind them. The
other battery would have simultaneously swept
the streets and open spaces with shrapnel.
With no high explosive, the only alternative
was to use long fuses in the shrapnel, which
then burst on percussion against the buildings
behind which the Huns were sheltering.</p>

<p>The observation from the front line was
chiefly valuable as a guide to the timing of the
shrapnel that was to be used to scatter the
hundreds of bullets over the open spaces. A
13-pounder shrapnel contained about 285 bullets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
an 18-pounder, 365. The timing fuses burst
none too accurately, at best. Atmospheric
conditions frequently affected the burning of
the fuses, and even the heating of the gun as
it went into action sometimes did so.</p>

<p>H and I Batteries, having obtained the
desired information from their observers as to
the range and timing of their twelve shells,
waited patiently until half past two o'clock.</p>

<p>At that hour, 400 shells were fired into
Lizerne. For the first five minutes each
battery fired four rounds per minute, then came
a two-minute interval. For the next five
minutes every one of the twelve guns in the
two batteries fired five shots per minute. A
second lull of two minutes was followed by still
more rapid fire for another five minutes, six
rounds per sixty seconds blazing forth from
each of the dozen field-pieces, seventy-two
shells per minute falling in the village. Thus
they continued, the spasm of firing and the
brief interval of stillness alternating, until the
400 shells had been fired.</p>

<p>That the work of the Horse Artillery was
well done was apparent from the result. Its
efficiency was confirmed later by captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Germans wounded in Lizerne, who termed the
place "Hell itself" while the initial bombardment
was in progress.</p>

<p>But the work of the guns was by no means
ended. The salvo died down at the appointed
time. The French Colonial Zouaves rushed
forward, bayonets in hand, with wild cries, and
then the gunners were set to their task.</p>

<p>They fired another 400 rounds at the road
from Steenstraate to Lizerne, a second road
leading to Lizerne from the south-east, and a
third road connecting the two. These three
roads were the avenues most likely to be
utilized by the Huns for bringing up reinforcements
to meet the attack. "Searching" the
roads and a couple of special points, one just
back of a rise of ground, where it seemed
possible reinforcements might be gathered,
kept the gunners hard at work.</p>

<p>Shrapnel rained over such spots, bursting
from twenty to thirty feet above ground, and
spreading death all about.</p>

<p>Watching the two batteries in action gave
me a high opinion of their abilities. Nothing
in modern warfare was so fascinating a study
as that of guns in action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>France, with her faith pinned to low trajectory
and high muzzle velocity as exemplified in her
wonderful "75's," and Germany's gun-religion,
centring on weight of shell, made a formidable
contrast.</p>

<p>The making of a field-piece was ever a
compromise between those two schools&mdash;a gun
firing a light shell straight and fast, or a gun in
which speed and direct line were sacrificed to
gain weight of projectile.</p>

<p>A 35-pound howitzer shell and an 18-pounder
shrapnel, such as that fired by the British field
artillery, were sent on their mission of death
from guns of practically the same weight.
Thus greatly did an increase in muzzle velocity
mean a corresponding increase in avoirdupois.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight hundredweight was generally
agreed by gun-experts the world over to be the
weight permissible for field pieces; this limit being
imposed by questions of mobility and transport.</p>

<p>It was to gain those assets so great to the
French military mind, low trajectory and high
muzzle velocity, that the weight of the "75"
shell was dropped to 15 pounds.</p>

<p>Howitzer against field-gun, with high explosive
shell for both, was German practice against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
French practice. As one who became very
tired of the continuous rain of big German
howitzer shells, I must confess a wholesome
respect for Hun theory in relation to questions
of modern artillery. But no German gun, light
or heavy, could, to my mind, compare with the
wonderful "75."</p>

<p>A return to General Putz's headquarters
found the French staff in possession of a report
from the Front, to the effect that the Algerian
Brigade had taken Lizerne, held all the trenches
on the west side of the canal, and were preparing
to cross the canal at Lizerne and Het-Sas.</p>

<p>Later developments showed the French
officers in the fighting line had again been
optimistic to a point of inaccuracy in reporting
Lizerne captured. The next day it was discovered
that the Germans still held two houses
on the western edge of canal, and had "dug
themselves in" in an entrenched bridge-head
on the canal bank. The French troops were
in a semicircle, 300 yards distant, and were
bringing up, under cover of the night, "75's"
on either side of the miniature German fort,
and preparing to batter it down by high-explosive
shells fired at point-blank range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division left the reserve
line before Lizerne was finally wholly clear of
Germans.</p>

<p>All day the din of battle on the long front had
been maddening. Ear-drums became tuned to
it for a time. But periods of acute sensitiveness
would recur, in which the sound seemed to beat
against one's brain with a dull ache, punctuated
with sharp pain from the constant concussion.</p>

<p>An evening message from 5th Corps Headquarters
told of the failure of the great attack
at 2 p.m., owing to gas fumes from the German
trenches. A later attack had been organised, in
which the Northumbrian Territorial Division had
won from the enemy some trenches south-west
of St. Julien, and then pushed on and captured
St. Julien itself. The Manchesters, too, had
taken some German trenches east of St. Julien.</p>

<p>But the good work was to be undone. That
night the Huns won back St. Julien, and by
daybreak on the 27th the line was practically
where it had been twenty-four hours earlier, in
spite of sad losses.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>April 27th saw another strenuous effort by
our gallant troops on that front. The southern
edge of a wood, situated less than a mile west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>of St. Julien, was penetrated, but later the men
returned to our original line.</p>

<p>The German official report said that the
Huns fairly mowed down British troops when
they advanced near St. Julien, and their
artillery caught our men as they were retiring
and inflicted frightful losses. Unfortunately,
there was no exaggeration in that report.</p>

<p>Arriving at our headquarters château, east of
Poperinghe, we found that half an hour earlier
a dozen or more 17-inch shells had fallen in
and about the town.</p>

<p>Poperinghe was being shelled daily, eleven
townsfolk having been killed on the afternoon
before. Most of the population had sought a
more salubrious locality.</p>

<p>Of great interest to us was a huge shell-hole
that had just been made in the château garden,
fifty yards from our sleeping quarters. It was
over thirty feet in diameter and ten or twelve
feet deep.</p>

<p>The big shell had shattered every window in
that district, and the concussion had ruined
most of the tiled roofs within sight. Great
shell splinters, weighing from five to thirty
pounds, still warm, were lying about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>That night, after eleven o'clock, when all
were asleep, four more 17-inch visitors arrived
in that edge of Poperinghe. All four shook
the château to its foundations, one falling
within 100 yards of it and smashing three
dwelling houses into one mass of splinters,
plaster and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>.</p>

<p>General de Lisle was sleeping on the floor
of the château dining room. The first of the
mammoth quartette so shook the building that
a lustre chandelier, housed in a dust-covering
and therefore unnoticed, became detached and
fell to the polished floor below. Its myriad
tiny pieces of glass jangled musically as they
showered over the General, who was sleeping
peacefully beneath. Fortunately, de Lisle was
not hit by any of the heavier portions of the
costly ornament, but his emotions on being
awakened from deep slumber by the resounding
smash of the shell, followed by the crash of the
falling chandelier and the attendant rain of
tuneful prisms, can better be imagined than
described.</p>

<p>For the rest of the night, the headquarters
staff&mdash;with the exception of de Lisle himself&mdash;repaired
to the cellar in search of less inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>rupted
repose. The General, having ascertained
that no other lustre chandelier was
suspended from the ceiling, stuck to his original
pitch.</p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak, 1st Cavalry
Division Headquarters moved from that
château, in spite of its many desirable attributes
as a habitation.</p>

<p>On the 27th, General de Lisle sent me to
the headquarters of Major Pilkington, of the
15th Hussars, on an errand. The reserve
Belgian line was hard by. In backing my car,
to turn it in the narrow lane, a bank of a
reserve trench or ditch caved, and the poor
car stood on its tail, at an uncomfortable and
astonishing angle. Colonel Burnett and one
of his 18th Hussar officers passed, and with
their help and that of a dozen obliging 15th
Hussar troopers, we attempted to move the
brute. It resisted our combined efforts. Then
the Belgians near by saw what had transpired
and came at a run. In a jiffy the car was out,
but having been lifted with more zeal than
discretion was strained in so many places that
it ran more like a crawfish than a car, until a
week later, when time and opportunity allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
me to substitute an ample and expensive list of
new parts.</p>

<p>Plodding through Poperinghe late that afternoon,
the first of seven or eight 17-inch Boche
"big 'uns" fell close behind me. I felt,
rather than heard, a crash, the wave of sound
deafening me. Missiles rained down sharply
on roofs, walls and paved roadway. Lame
duck though it was, the car lifted itself and
sped at a touch of the accelerator pedal. I
heard some of the other shells explode, but
was well out of harm's way by the time they
arrived.</p>

<p>On the 28th of April the Division was moved
back to a bivouac in the woods that lined the
Poperinghe&mdash;Proven road, the main highway
to Dunkirk.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, after a splendid day of
lying in the sun, which was greatly appreciated
by the whole Division, billets to the westward
were assigned to us, and we trekked off without
delay.</p>

<p>Wormhoudt, a French-Flemish town on the
main road from Dunkirk to Cassel, was selected
for headquarters, and there we rested for four
days before returning to our old home, the La
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Nieppe château, on the road from Cassel to
St. Omer.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En route</i> to Wormhoudt we passed the
Indian Cavalry, coming up to relieve us as
reserve. The Poona Horse, Sind Lancers,
and Inniskilling Dragoons presented a fine
appearance as they rode by.</p>

<p>Rest was welcome to the Division. The troops
had not been in the actual firing-line, but had
been in continual occupation of reserve trenches
for days, frequently under heavy shell-fire, and
rarely with an opportunity for taking off their
boots or sleeping elsewhere than in the open.</p>

<p>The villages and farms around Wormhoudt
provided excellent billets for the troopers.
Barns filled with straw and flax were warm and
comfortable resting-places after the days and
nights in cold, damp trenches.</p>

<p>So April ended peacefully for us, the
Germans holding what they had won on the
23rd and closing the month with a vigorous
bombardment of Dunkirk, a few miles north
of us, which served no useful military purpose,
but gave the Huns the satisfaction of killing a
fair number of civilians, including a good bag
of women and children.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">The first days of May found me with
but little work to do.</p>

<p>I spent some of my time running
up into the Salient and hearing talk of preparations
for a withdrawal of our line to a smaller
horseshoe around Ypres. This was to be done
as soon as all was ready for the move, and the
utmost secrecy enveloped the operations.</p>

<p>I saw Rex Benson, of the 9th Lancers, who
was acting temporarily as liaison officer with
the French troops along the canal north of
Ypres. Rex said the French had made but
little progress towards the Pilkem ridge and
General Putz had apparently decided to concentrate
his position and give up open assault
for the present.</p>

<p>The Hun howitzer fire was so fierce along
the roads when I skirted Ypres on May 1st
that I decided to desist visiting the Salient.
In short, I got "cold feet" about the Ypres
roads, and decided to do my joy-riding in other
directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Romer Williams, of the 4th D.G.'s, and I
went to St. Omer on the 2nd and brought
out a couple of Romer's Red Cross friends,
one a San Franciscan, named Sherman, at
whose billet we had found marvellous cocktails.
We all dined at General Mullens' headquarters,
a gay party.</p>

<p>As we were feasting, the Huns in front
of Ypres were up to more devilment. They
let loose a heavy gas attack on the evening
of the 2nd and made the British trenches south
of St. Julien untenable. Our men retired, but
the gas hung stationary for a few moments,
and prevented an immediate German advance.
This fortunate pause gave time for a concentration
of all our guns on the spot. When the
gas had dispersed sufficiently to allow an
advance by the enemy, our gunners threw a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barrage de feu</i> across the German front as it
emerged from St. Julien and the little wood
to the west of it, and effectually stopped the
way. Meantime, our men had regained their
trenches.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Division, dismounted, was
called up as support during this attack. To
reach the trenches into which they were ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they found it necessary to advance across an
enemy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barrage de feu</i>. The 4th Hussars and
5th Lancers were the regiments engaged. For
a time it seemed they would be badly cut up,
but luckily they got through the curtain of
shells with only forty killed.</p>

<p>So <em>some</em> cavalry units had been thrown into
the actual line, after all.</p>

<p>On the 3rd the 1st Cavalry Division moved
back to its previous winter billets, the Headquarters
Staff again repairing to the La Nieppe
château.</p>

<p>The Huns attacked our Ypres line all day
on the 4th, but with no success. That night
the evacuation of the extreme eastern section
of the Salient was carried out without serious
casualty.</p>

<p>The enemy patrols that poked through the
Polygon Wood at daybreak on the 4th, and
discovered the British retirement to a line
further west, must indeed have been surprised.</p>

<p>The fighting of the previous ten days had
cost the Allies over thirty square miles of
ground and more than 20,000 casualties, but
the British Army had undoubtedly gained in
morale, nevertheless. Colonials and Territorials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
as well as old line regiments filled with new
reserve men, had fought shoulder to shoulder
with the veterans of Le Cateau and the
Aisne, every unit gaining strength unconsciously
as each contingent rose in the other's
estimation. Mutual admiration and mutual
confidence had welded the Army all the more
closely together.</p>

<p>On a call at 5th Corps Headquarters at
Abele, west of Poperinghe, I saw a couple
of what appeared to be divers' helmets. These
were loaded into a car, with a good-sized roll
of rubber tubing and a homely pair of bellows
attached to each of the grotesque pieces of
headgear.</p>

<p>Curious, I asked a "Q" officer, standing near
by, just how this paraphernalia was to be used.</p>

<p>"People get strange ideas about fighting
gas," he said. "These outfits were designed
and forwarded to us to be sent up front, so up
front I am sending them. They are provided
to allow some of our men, say about 3 in
every 10,000, so far as present supply goes, to
stay in the gas-filled trenches while some pals
with the bellows pump good air to them through
a few hundred feet of hose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the gas area should be of considerable
extent the chap with the bellows would soon
be pumping chlorine into his fellow-Tommy,
and die pumping at that, or else take to the
woods and let the diver himself get what air
he could find.</p>

<p>"Many accidents might befall the tube. A
Hun might sit on it. I hate to think of myself,
squatting in a trench with one of those things
over my head, praying for air, with the bellows
man pumping his heart out trying to get ozone
through a rubber tube on top of which some
fat Boche had plumped, while he potted away
at one or the other of us.</p>

<p>"A shell, too, would have an interesting
time with such a tube. Imagine the chap in
the helmet hollering, 'Pump away, you lazy
beggar, I'm not getting enough air to keep a
flea alive,' and all the good old oxygen pouring
out of a jagged hole in the bally pipe, hundreds
of feet from him.</p>

<p>"Then, suppose a man, coming up before
daylight, got his foot caught in that length of
tube," he continued enthusiastically&mdash;but I
realised I had started something I couldn't
stop, and fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 5th I found E. F. Lumsden, of the
A.S.C., an old friend with a passion for car
repair of all sorts, who had charge of the lorries
and motor workshops attached to the 7th
Brigade Royal Garrison Artillery Ammunition
Park. His lot were in Estaires. I turned my
car over to them for rejuvenation while I hied
myself to London to purchase an alarmingly
large collection of parts with which to assist
the somewhat extensive rebuilding Lumsden
had gleefully planned.</p>

<p>I was back with a heavy load of hardware
and empty purse by the night of May 7th,
and by midnight on the 8th left Estaires with
my chariot, which was in a greatly chastened
mood.</p>

<p>While I was on leave in England the
troopers of the 1st Cavalry Division had spent
their nights in the Ypres Salient digging
reserve line trenches and making barbed wire
entanglements. Ypres on fire, the trench line
alight with flares and the flash of constant
shell-bursts, made this work more spectacular
than pleasant. Once or twice a shell fell
sufficiently near the troopers to wound one or
two. One Black Maria unfortunately dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
among a squadron of the 18th Hussars, killing
two of them and wounding a couple of dozen
more.</p>

<p>Lunching on the 8th with a gunners' mess
on the Laventie front, I learned of a big
"push" ordered at dawn on the 9th. The
Auber ridge was to be attacked from the south-west
by two Indian Divisions, and from the
north-west by the 8th Division and the 7th
Division, with the Northumbrian Territorial
Division and the newly arrived West Riding
Territorial Division somewhere about. Something
like 120,000 men were thus to be
engaged. The Canadian Division was in
reserve, in addition, and the 9th Division,
the first of the "K" troops to reach the
Front, was expected by rail that night.</p>

<p>The 6th Division, in the Bois Grenier area,
was ready and eager to push forward toward
Lille if the Auber ridge attack proved successful.</p>

<p>Instructions had been given, in anticipation
of any misunderstandings which might tend to
lead to another fiasco like the battle of Neuve
Chapelle. Orders were issued that troops in
certain areas were to push on and not delay,
because telephonic communication had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
established. The order of the day asked the
troops to "break a hole in the enemy's line,"
and assured the attacking Divisions that the
whole Army was behind, ready to deal sledge-hammer
blows on the broken German front.</p>

<p>My gunner friends confidently expected to
sleep in Lille on the night of the 9th, and
proceeded jocosely to mark on a map of that
city the houses each one chose as his billet.
Roads to Lille had been selected for the
ammunition columns, and orders given which
would ensure a supply of shells that far forward,
in case the attack "got through."</p>

<p>All was excitement when I left that front in
the small hours of the morning of the 9th, and
greatly would I have loved to stay and see
the Auber Ridge attack at daybreak. But at
early morning light on Sunday, May 9th, the
1st Cavalry Division, placed under the orders
of General Plumer, who had taken General
Smith-Dorrien's place as the General Officer
commanding the 2nd Army, was once more
to be sent to Ypres.</p>

<p>Things had not gone well in the Salient on
the 8th. The 5th Corps, then under General
Allenby, who had been promoted from Cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Corps, was composed of the 4th, 27th and
28th Divisions. These troops had been driven
from their first-line trenches by a strenuous
German attack, and had fallen back to the
next line with heavy casualties.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Brigade had been rushed
early on the 9th into the reserve trenches east
of Ypres, and were in readiness from Potijze
south to the Menin Road. The 1st Cavalry
Brigade and the 9th Cavalry Brigade were
near Vlamertinghe, west of Ypres, waiting
orders.</p>

<p>The Huns had begun a ferocious onslaught
on that perfect Sunday morning, and the roar
of battle around Ypres drowned, in our ears,
the noise of the 1st Army attack towards
Aubers.</p>

<p>That 9th of May was to see bitter fighting
on many fronts. The enemy attack on the
Ypres Salient, and our "push" against the
Auber ridge, were pregnant with bloody work,
but away to the south, in front of Arras, the
French Army was commencing the second day
of the biggest attack it had yet planned since
the winter mud had limited the fighting to
trench warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Five hundred thousand men and 2,000 guns
were hammering at the German front, in an
effort to break through to Douai, and though
it was too early to expect a detailed report
of the onslaught, word had come that the
soldiers of France had won through in three
places.</p>

<p>On the Russian front the German arms were
crowned with success on that day, in a gigantic
conflict, and the day before saw the sinking
of the Lusitania and the sacrifice of its load of
women and children.</p>

<p>One seemed to live many hours in a few
minutes in those May days. All-engrossed
with the work in hand, we were none the less
anxious to hear of the great movements about
us, in which our interests were not less keen
than in the fighting in our own immediate area.</p>

<p>The new British line around Ypres ran
from the French right, 2,000 yards east of the
Yser-Ypres Canal, and about the same distance
north of St. Jean, east for a mile or so to a
homestead dubbed the Canadian Farm, then
south-east across the Ypres-St. Julien road, and
across another road that previously had served
as a secondary route to Passchendaele.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>From that point the trenches led south,
passing to the west of Verlorenhoek, a town
on the Ypres-Zonnebeke road. South again,
and a little east, they crossed the Ypres-Roulers
railway, skirted the western and the
southern shores of the Bellewaarde Lake, took
in the grounds of the ruined Hooge château
and the eastern fringe of the woods that
surrounded it, passed east of Hooge, and thus
reached the famous Ypres-Menin road.</p>

<p>On went the line, winding snakelike through
the eastern edge of the Sanctuary Wood, south
of the Menin Road. Here the Salient reached
its furthermost eastern extremity.</p>

<p>Then began a south-westerly trend, less than
a mile in front of Zillebeke, reaching Zaartsteen
before crossing the Ypres-Comines railway
and later the Ypres-Comines canal.</p>

<p>From the canal the trenches ran more west
than south to St. Eloi, then still on to the
westward, until they circled south, away from
Ypres, in front of Vierstraat, Kemmel and
Wolverghem successively. There they faced,
then passed Messines, reached the Ploegsteert
Wood, crossed the River Lys and bent round
Armentières, on their way through the Auber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and Neuve Chapelle area, to the Festubert
and La Bassée fronts.</p>

<p>Early morning on that eventful Sunday found
me driving General de Lisle and Hardress
Lloyd to Ypres, straight through the devastated
old city, out of the Menin gate, over the Menin
bridge and on up the Zonnebeke Road as far
as Potijze.</p>

<p>From the railway crossing at the western
edge of Ypres, past the smashed cathedral of
St. Martin, round the ruins of the Cloth Hall,
through the Grande Place, and down the Rue
de Menin, dead horses and men lined the way.</p>

<p>Ypres, which I had seen shelled so heavily
time after time without its semblance of a city
being destroyed, was at last indescribably in
ruins. The slender pinnacles at the ends of
the Cloth Hall still stood, and the tower itself
had not fallen, though it had been so riddled it
seemed in imminent danger of collapse. The
tall torn tower of St. Martin's, near by, was
also standing.</p>

<p>I found great difficulty in picking my way
through the square, past shell-holes, piles of
paving blocks, and heaps of dead horses. At
one end of the Grande Place a howitzer shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
had burst directly on an artillery limber, the
horses and men being piled indiscriminately
together, every one instantly killed. They lay
in a heap on the broken stones of the square.</p>

<p>Our previous brewery headquarters was
levelled to the ground, and the house where
we had slept when last in Ypres was smashed
out of all recognition.</p>

<p>Shells were falling in Ypres as we went
through it. Across the Menin bridge the road,
once a broad highway, had been narrowed to a
mere path by pile on pile of shell-strewn bricks
and stones. The houses were one by one
completely disappearing, as though the space
they occupied was required for other purposes,
and the demolition of each one of them was a
preconceived part of a plan of extinction of all
signs of habitation.</p>

<p>Dead horses in dozens along the way lay
close to the wheel track. We passed an
ambulance, its front portion torn away by a
shell, and then the remnants of a supply
wagon, smashed to matchwood.</p>

<p>As we sped on, as fast as the continual
obstructions and deep shell-holes would allow,
shells fell behind us, screeching overhead every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
few seconds with strange, weird, discordant
notes, culminating in a reverberating bang!
that seemed thrown back at us by the high
walls across the moat.</p>

<p>The dozens of dead horses became scores as
we pushed on. Some fields by the road were
literally covered with them.</p>

<p>A signals corps man told me that at one
point his orders for dark night journeys across
those fields were as follows: "Go down the
hedge till you reach the ditch, turn right, and
go toward the big pile of dead horses until you
come to the gap in the next hedge." Those
instructions could be easily followed on the
blackest night, if one's olfactory nerves were in
working order.</p>

<p>Every breath of air seemed to our unaccustomed
nostrils to be charged with noisome
smells.</p>

<p>As we approached Potijze the infantry fire
grew less in volume. The Hun onslaught, the
first of five distinct attacks to be pushed home
by the Germans that day, had failed, and the
breathing space was the more heavily punctuated
by the howitzer shells for half an hour,
as if in a special spleen of disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the British guns had been withdrawn
from the Salient and to the west of the canal.
Two batteries of 18-pounders left near Potijze
were firing with the valour of one hundred as
we came up. But field-guns of light calibre,
firing shrapnel, have less voice in an argument
than the heavy howitzers with their 6-inch,
8-inch, or 14-inch high explosive shells. The
Huns' howitzers on that Ypres front must have
outnumbered our heavy ordnance by at least
twenty to one that Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Long straggling strings of wounded soldiers
trickled past on the Potijze road, making their
way painfully around Ypres to the north-west,
for to linger long on the Menin road, over
which we had come, was to court sure death.</p>

<p>General de Lisle stopped the car not far
from the Potijze château, and he and Hardress
Lloyd walked through a field to the dug-out in
which General Mullens had established 2nd
Cavalry Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>I turned the car and backed it between two
walls of what once were dwelling-houses.
Sitting close to the bottom of the wall, beside
the car, I counted shell intervals while waiting.
From two to three shells burst near the Potijze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
cross-roads every minute, but by far the greater
number of Hun projectiles went on, over my
head, to the Menin bridge and Ypres.</p>

<p>A good-sized bough from a tree above
dropped on my head, and a piece of shell
casing, quite hot, struck my foot as it fell,
spent, beside me.</p>

<p>For ten minutes splinters swept the roadway
continuously, and the stream of wounded ceased
to pour by until the fury of the sudden bombardment
had spent itself. The constant shock of
concussion was nerve-racking.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour the shells fell less
frequently, though odd ones struck the road at
intervals.</p>

<p>Behind the Verlorenhoek-Hooge line was a
smaller Salient, called the G.H.Q. line. It
served as a support position, and between it
and the canal were whole colonies of dug-outs.</p>

<p>Much of the G.H.Q. line was so situated
that a parapet of sandbags, in full sight of the
German observers, made it a frequent target.
On some days during the fighting that followed
the casualties in the G.H.Q. line rivalled those
in the front trenches. It was never a popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
resting place, and was often the subject of
much vituperation.</p>

<p>General de Lisle and Lloyd returned to the
car, and nearer Ypres made another halt to
visit the reserve dug-outs in the fields toward
the St. Jean road.</p>

<p>"Take good cover, President," said the
General, as he started across a shell-torn
meadow.</p>

<p>Easier said than done, I thought.</p>

<p>The lee of a house wall sheltered an empty
biscuit-tin, on which I perched, under a lean-to
of rough boards. The sky showed a fairy blue
through hundreds of holes in the sheet-iron
roof of the rudely constructed shed, evidence
that a bursting shell above had "scattered"
splendidly.</p>

<p>In spite of shell interludes I had one or two
interesting chats with passers-by. A hospital
corps sergeant told me the Huns shelled the
Zonnebeke road, beside which we were chatting,
every time they saw a transport on it.</p>

<p>"They give it hell when something moves
over it," he said impressively. "Just let us
bring an ambulance up here in the daytime,
and see them get busy, the devils."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's nice," said I. "Do you think
they could see my car when it went up to
Potijze?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he replied with conviction. "Sure.
If they haven't shelled you yet they <em>will</em>, all
right, don't <em>you</em> worry."</p>

<p>He left me cogitating, as he strode off
whistling, evidently unaware he had put anything
but comforting ideas in my head.</p>

<p>All those who came from "up there" agreed
as to one thing&mdash;the storm of howitzer-shells
made one's chance of living through a "turn in
the trenches" extremely slim. Many men were
undeniably demoralised by it.</p>

<p>"The few of my poor chaps that are left," a
28th Division subaltern told me, "seem to have
the idea their number is up. They keep saying
that if they don't get it to-day they'll sure get
it to-morrow. Hardly any of them have much
hope of getting out alive. I keep trying to
hearten 'em, but it's rotten work. Every time
I rip out something intended to be cheerful
along comes a Jack Johnson and blows up a
whole bally section of trench, burying alive
those it don't kill. Then the poor beggars
alongside just nod at each other and say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
'You and me next, Bill,' and what in hell <em>can</em>
I tell 'em?</p>

<p>"Why in the deuce we don't have more
guns up here <em>I'd</em> like to know. It does get
sickening to be shelled, and shelled, and
shelled, day and night, and hear so little of the
same sort of stuff going over <em>their</em> way. Damn
the German guns, anyway."</p>

<p>I sympathised with him, and told him so.</p>

<p>"I would like to see what de Lisle would
do if <em>he</em> was running the guns," I told him.
"He would send some hell of his own making
over to those Huns if <em>he</em> was doing it, from
what I have heard him say."</p>

<p>Odd prophetic fragment of comfort, that.
Three days thereafter de Lisle was given
command of the whole Verlorenhoek-Hooge
front and all the artillery east of the canal, a
territory which he soon had "stiff with guns."
In spite of the preponderance of the Germans
in heavy ordnance our gunners gave the enemy
good packages of the medicine with which our
hammered troops had been dosed for so many
weary days.</p>

<p>The run back over the Menin Bridge and
through Ypres safely accomplished, we visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the headquarters of General Snow, commanding
28th Division. While waiting there a
Hun howitzer shell ambled lazily over my
head and exploded a couple of hundred yards
beyond, throwing up a great cloud of black
smoke.</p>

<p>"Enemy airmen spotted this little lot," said
a passing "red-hat." "Warm time coming for
Snow."</p>

<p>His anxiety was unnecessary, however, for
the next shell went much further over us, and
another two further still, as if searching for
moving troops far behind the line.</p>

<p>The 3rd Cavalry Division troopers, loaded
in motor-buses, went Ypres-ward during the
afternoon. General Sir Julian Byng had taken
Allenby's place at Cavalry Corps, and General
Briggs had been given command of the
3rd Cavalry Division in Byng's place. The
British Army contained no finer soldier than
Briggs. This left the 1st Cavalry Brigade
without a G.O.C., as General Meakin, who
had been appointed to that command, was in
England on sick leave. Consequently Colonel
"Tommy" Pitman, of the 11th Hussars, was
placed in temporary command of the 1st Brigade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Pitman, like Briggs, was a born leader of men&mdash;a
tower of strength in himself.</p>

<p>Once during the afternoon my work took me
to Ypres, but not beyond it. A fresh attack
was on, and the Boches were sweeping the
Menin Bridge and the road beyond with
shrapnel.</p>

<p>Even Macfarlane's intrepid motor-cyclists
could no longer go over it with their signal
corps messages; but were compelled to dismount,
leave their motor-bikes in Ypres, and
proceed on foot to Potijze by a roundabout
route through the fields. Those cyclists
generally used a road long after it had been
given up as impassable by everyone else,
and when they at last abandoned it as too
dangerous for use it was indeed time, in their
parlance, "to give it a miss."</p>

<p>Our 2nd Brigade troops were under intermittent
shell-fire all that day, but came through
with unusual good fortune. One shell lit in a
group of 18th Hussars, killed five and wounded
eight, but the other units escaped with extraordinarily
few casualties.</p>

<p>At the headquarters of General Bulfin,
Commanding 28th Division, Lord Loch, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
was G.S.O. 1, on General Bulfin's Staff, gave
us a very welcome tea.</p>

<p>From one of the 28th Division Staff I
learned that the 4th, 27th and 28th Divisions
had been through a more terrible time in the
Salient than we had known. Snow's Division,
the 27th, were terribly depleted in numbers.
"Not many men left, and very few officers
indeed," was the sober way Snow had spoken
of his lot that day.</p>

<p>The five heavy attacks of the 9th, in spite of
the battered condition of the heroic men who
faced them, resulted in no real gains and the
Germans suffered severe losses.</p>

<p>We sought eagerly for news of the British
attack along the Auber ridge. Early in the
morning word had come that the 8th Division
had made a splendid beginning by taking the
German first line trenches in front of them.
In the afternoon we heard that the 4th Corps
"got on" well, but the Indian Corps and
1st Corps were held up by machine-gun fire
and had made no progress. A further attack
was to be made at 4 p.m. on the 10th. On
the 11th, the G.H.Q. information summary
remarked, laconically, that there was "nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to report from the 1st Army Front." So the
big attack, of which my gunner friends along
the Fromelle Road had such hopes, had fizzled
out.</p>

<p>Weeks afterwards I heard the full story
from the lips of men who were in the front of
the fighting, but our task in Ypres was growing
hourly sufficiently absorbing, so that the whys
and wherefores of Rawlinson's failure to break
through were of less interest than the question
of repelling the German attack on the Salient.</p>

<p>As dusk drew on the conflagrations in Ypres
lit up the eastern sky. Our night headquarters
were in a château not far west of the unfortunate
town.</p>

<p>Wounded still straggled back in small groups,
and ambulances arrived every few minutes at
a dressing station hard by the gates of our
château.</p>

<p>Watching those ambulances unload made
me proud to be an Anglo-Saxon. The men
were magnificent in their incomparable morale.
Many a smiling face hid teeth set hard in pain.
Many a Tommy knows not only the inestimable
value of keeping a stout heart to help himself
through, but the immeasurably greater treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of an ample store of cheery words and light-hearted
jokes wherewith to lift a comrade from
pain-racked despondency.</p>

<p>Broken bodies, broken limbs, and many a
broken head were there in plenty, but one
looked far to find a broken spirit.</p>

<p>Before we went to sleep, good news came
from the French. All the way from Loos
south to Lens, it said, and on through Thelus
to Arras, the German first-line trenches had
been captured, save in two places. On the
10th, the French reported having taken
2,000 prisoners and ten guns. In spite of all,
the succeeding days' reports whittled down
the final result to a tactical success, not a
strategical one. The break in the German
line was made good by the enemy in short
order, and soon Gaul and Teuton were facing
each other much as they had done, previously,
and the inch-by-inch battles of the Labyrinth
were soaking the ground of France's black
country with French and German blood.</p>

<p>The big French attack and the British
"push" had equally failed to smash the German
line.</p>

<p>On our front British soldiers were to continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to show that their line could hold as solidly
as the Hun line had held to the south, in
spite of the hell of howitzer-fire that was daily
to be let loose in the Salient.</p>

<p>Rocked to sleep by the earth-tremble of
bursting tons of high explosive, day-dawn on
May 10th seemed to come the next moment
after my head had hit the floor which served
me as a pillow.</p>

<p>Before seven o'clock in the morning I was
again in the Salient and once more under shell-fire.</p>

<p>Taking Colonel Home through Ypres and
over the Menin bridge, we were not long in
reaching Potijze.</p>

<p>The weather was perfect, hundreds of small
birds hopping about the roadways and twittering
excitedly, as if protesting to each other
against the continual coming of the shells.</p>

<p>Behind a ruined house near the Potijze
crossroads, I made a lucky discovery. Someone
had built a comfy little dug-out, six feet
by four and nearly three feet deep, into which
I at once repaired. Its earthen walls were
reinforced by heavy planks, and a roof of
earth-covered timbers was edged with barrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and sacks of bricks and mortar. Ponchos lined
the inside of the walls, and the floor was deep
with straw. On a shelf stood the remains of a
ham bone and a tin half full of marmalade.</p>

<p>With thirty to forty jarring explosions in the
vicinity every minute, this habitation was little
short of ideal, save for the smell, which was
fierce in its intensity and persistence.</p>

<p>The earth of the open spaces near by was
thrown into yellow and brown heaps by the
hundreds of howitzer shells that had rained on
them for days. Dozens of dead horses, scattered
about, offended the eye and polluted the air.</p>

<p>A detachment of troopers, bent on rendering
the trenches of the near by G.H.Q. line a more
safe shelter, had been spied by the Hun gunners,
who for hours sent a continual shower of shells
over them.</p>

<p>I had not waited long before I found I was
not the only occupant of my shelter. My
companions bit me surreptitiously, leaving red
blotches which burned irritatingly.</p>

<p>I sat in the open air for a few moments,
deciding there was not sufficient room in the
dug-out for my small but persistent comrades
and myself, but a big shell landed near and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
sent such a spattering horde of splinters all
around that I ducked back underground and
took my chance with the less serious wounds
of the busy little dug-out folk, who seemed
half starved, in spite of the ham bone and
marmalade that had been left to them.</p>

<p>A couple of worried, hungry mongrel dogs
came nosing about fearfully, heads cocked
inquisitively when they caught sight of me.
I gave them the bone and was thanked by a
series of tailwags from each.</p>

<p>A Hun shell set fire to a building not far
distant, and soon immense clouds of black and
saffron smoke were rolling heavenwards.</p>

<p>Many shells came close to where I was
tucked away, one throwing a cart load of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>
over my car, but none of them in the least
disturbing the tranquillity of my snug quarters.</p>

<p>Returning through Ypres, we found the
Menin Road and bridge had been further
hammered since we had come over it. At one
or two points it was almost impassable for a
car. The carcass of a dead horse had been
blown right across the path, so that I was
compelled to pass over part of it.</p>

<p>Houses were smoking on all sides, and red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
flames rose skyward in several quarters of the
town.</p>

<p>A solitary old woman in black was picking
her way tortuously past the dead and over the
tumbled piles of brick and stone. She was,
we thought, the last survivor of the civil
population.</p>

<p>General Adeney, of the 12th Brigade, called
at 1st Cavalry Division Headquarters and told
me of the heavy shelling on the front that his
brigade had held. The signal wire from his
headquarters to that of his Division was cut by
shell-fire fifty-five times in one day. His men
had gone through a terrible time, but had stood
it magnificently. General Adeney had wide
experience with the Hun gas, and assured us
its effects could be greatly nullified if care was
taken to follow out the instructions as to the
use of the respirators and face-masks, which
had been issued to each man whose duty took
him into the Salient.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Brigade went from the
G.H.Q. line to the front position during the
evening, but were relieved by the 1st Cavalry
Brigade before the next morning. The
1st Brigade spent the day in dug-outs in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
little wood near the Ypres-Roulers Railway,
close to the trenches. Shell-fire had cost
the 2nd Brigade thirteen killed and fifty-four
wounded during its occupancy of the G.H.Q.
line.</p>

<p>The 9th Cavalry Brigade reported itself
"quite comfortable" in splendid dug-outs near
Wieltje, but the shells wounded four of its
officers and eighteen of its men, nevertheless.</p>

<p>From the windows of our headquarters
château the fires of Ypres could be seen
burning brightly all night, a red splash on the
inky black of the horizon. Bursting shells and
the flash of our guns never ceased. Bright
stars dotted the dark canopy overhead, and
brilliant trench-flares rose and fell in graceful
arcs. The wonderful, ever-changing sight and
the continual diapason of the heavy explosives
was awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Early morning usually came with a lull in
the gun-fire on both sides, unless an attack was
in progress. We hurried through breakfast on
the 11th, and lost no time in getting away for
Potijze.</p>

<p>General de Lisle, Major "Bertie" Fisher,
of the 17th Lancers, who had joined de Lisle's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Staff as G.S.O. 2 (in place of Major Fitzgerald,
promoted to G.S.O. 1 of the 2nd Cavalry
Division), and Captain Hardress Lloyd were
my passengers.</p>

<p>The rumph! r-r-rumph! of itinerant Black
Marias told us that German hate still held
against shattered Ypres. As we approached
the town one or two heavy explosions were
followed by a cloud of dust and smoke where
the shells had fallen on a building already a
heap of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> and scattered its remains high
in the air.</p>

<p>At the railway crossing west of Ypres
several newly made shell-chasms made me pick
my path warily. All the way to the Grande
Place shell-holes and gathering piles of rubbish
and timbers made progress difficult.</p>

<p>The space in front of the cathedral was
knee-deep in loose paving blocks and stones.</p>

<p>As we turned the corner of the Cloth Hall,
and could see the battered square, our sight
was arrested by brilliant sheets of scarlet flame
edged black, that shot across the Rue de
Menin ahead of us.</p>

<p>The bright morning sun and blue, cloudless
sky above, the grey and white ruins on every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
hand, and the blood-red, leaping, straining,
struggling patch of angry flame that roared in our
faces as we drew near to it, made a picture that
would have delighted the heart of an artist.</p>

<p>I stopped the car.</p>

<p>The General at first counselled rushing
through the fire, but I dreaded the result.
Even should we have dashed past unscathed,
the thought of the petrol in the car made me
hesitate.</p>

<p>Then, beyond the conflagration, we saw that
a house at the western approach to the Menin
bridge had been knocked over by a shell, and
so fallen that it completely blocked the road.
Half a hundred men must work for hours
before the Menin bridge would once more be
open for traffic, though fortunately the bridge
itself was undamaged.</p>

<p>Reversing the car and regaining the Grande
Place, I threaded my way past deep holes in
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i>, and cautiously clambered over piles
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> as we sought another route eastward.
Along a street where desolation reigned
supreme we went, until we reached the eastern
moat wall. Turning north, we sought an
outlet on the St. Jean road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Pushing over great fallen timbers, nail-studded
and threatening a puncture at every
revolution of the wheels, over, by and into
holes in the paved road, it seemed impossible
the car could surmount and pass the mounds
of wreckage and paving-blocks that filled the
way.</p>

<p>Over the railway we crawled, and to the
very northern edge of Ypres. Just as we
were congratulating ourselves on having won
through, in spite of apparently insurmountable
difficulties, a monster shell-cavity, thirty feet
in diameter, and so deep as to be absolutely
impassable for the car, opened in front of us.</p>

<p>The road was wide, but the shell had fallen
in its centre, heaping the earth and stone at
the edges of the gaping crater until it blocked
the street from side to side.</p>

<p>General de Lisle and his two companions
dismounted and proceeded on foot, instructing
me to "be careful and get home safely."</p>

<p>Heading the way I had come was a task
of some magnitude. Pneumatic tyres were not
made to traverse shell-torn roads covered with
glass, nails, and sharp bits of iron and stone,
but my trusty Dunlops did not fail me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>In the square I stopped to get a photograph
of a fire that was enveloping the houses at the
back of the cathedral. Every building in the
district was burning, some smouldering and
smoking threateningly, while the flames raged
fiercely from top to bottom of others standing
near.</p>

<p>As I pulled up, a fearful crash came from
the Menin bridge not far behind me, the shock
of the concussion almost throwing me down.
Giving up all idea of procuring pictures under
such circumstances, I ignominiously fled as fast
as it was safe to go.</p>

<p>Passing the cathedral, I saw a fine collie dog,
his tail between his legs, slinking along furtively.
I called him, dismounting from the car and
trying to induce him to come to me, but he was
scared so badly he only ran the faster at my
approach.</p>

<p>In the western edge of Ypres a worn, drawn-faced
Belgian, with a hunted look in his eyes,
was slowly and carefully shoving a wheelbarrow,
on which was a rude pallet. Stretched
upon it lay the wasted form of a frail woman,
close-swathed in as much bedding as the
method of conveyance would allow. Her skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was wax-white, her wide eyes large and
lustrous. She had not sufficient strength to
prevent her feet from trailing the ground. An
aged crone shuffled beside the sick woman,
on her face a picture of agonised fear painful
to see.</p>

<p>Big Hun guns were searching for little
British ones not far away, and at every detonation
the poor old woman jumped nervously.</p>

<p>An offer of assistance met with no response, as
if they were past all capability of communication.
The horrors they must have gone through for
weeks in some cellar in that stricken town
baffle imagination.</p>

<p>They were undoubtedly the last of the
residents of Ypres to leave the town alive. If
others remained, it was but to be buried under
the falling walls of their hiding places, or to
meet a worse fate in the flames that were
raging from one end of the city to the other.</p>

<p>Vlamertinghe received a sharp shelling that
forenoon, and a few minutes afterward I took
General de Lisle through the town to the
headquarters of General Wilson of the 4th
Division. As we ran through Vlamertinghe,
Tommies were busy sweeping the roadway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
clear of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> thrown about by the shells five
minutes before.</p>

<p>When at General Bulfin's Headquarters
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i> a quarter of an hour later, I saw
Hun shrapnel again begin bursting in twos
over Vlamertinghe, which was gradually becoming
an unhealthy locality.</p>

<p>The clear air brought out dozens of aeroplanes,
which kept the anti-aircraft guns busy.
The Germans sent up a couple of weird
"sausages"&mdash;anchored observation balloons of
peculiar shape.</p>

<p>The amount of ammunition used in the
continuous shelling of the trench line was
stupendous.</p>

<p>On one run toward Ypres I passed the
"Princess Pat's" (Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry), fresh from the 27th Division
trenches, and on their way to a rest in billets.
They were indeed a sturdy lot. All forenoon
the Huns shelled our front line from the Menin
Road to the north as it passed the Hooge
Château and circled the Bellewaarde Lake.
Wounded men poured back through Ypres
from the Front, marvelling that they had
escaped death in the trenches, and wondering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>still more that they had not been blown to
atoms as they trudged back along the deadly
Menin Road.</p>

<p>A wounded trooper of the 11th Hussars
reported his regiment unpleasantly situated in
bad dug-outs in a wood, between the Ypres-Roulers
Railway and the Bellewaarde Lake.
The dug-outs were not of sufficient size to
accommodate the whole of the 11th, and when
a detachment of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders
claimed shelter therein as well, the
congestion became dangerous. The Hun shells
burst immediately over the dug-outs, and some
casualties had occurred before morning dawned.
So little accommodation seemed available that
one squadron of the 11th had been sent back
to the G.H.Q. line, where it had been badly
hammered by howitzer fire for hour after hour
as the morning passed.</p>

<p>Romer Williams and I walked from our
château to a "Mother" gun, concealed under a
screen of dry branches in a near-by farmyard.
The big 9·2 howitzer was throwing its 290-pound
projectiles, filled with lyddite, into the
Hun trenches in front of Hooge, nearly 9,000
yards distant. The five-mile journey was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
accomplished by each shell in 35 seconds, a
rate of more than 500 miles per hour. Dodging
a shell which was coming at such speed would
be something of a feat.</p>

<p>Yet, standing directly behind the breech, we
could distinctly see the 9·2 shell as it left the
muzzle and started on its sinister errand.</p>

<p>For so huge an engine of war its paraphernalia
was simple. The howitzer stood on a
platform built into the farmyard. Rows of
shells, each a load for four men, lay in a ditch
behind it. On a log, under a tall tree, sat the
captain gunner, by his side a non-com. busy
figuring out mathematical equations, and
another poring over a large-scale map. With
his back to the tree crouched a Royal Flying
Corps man, his receiver to his ear, and an
elaborate box of wireless telegraphic tricks
beside him. Across the road a slender pole, a
score of feet in height, completed his wireless
installation.</p>

<p>"Fire!" said the captain, sharply.</p>

<p>Flash! bang! "Mother" recoiled with a
shock and returned leisurely. Not a big noise
or a very trying one on the ears of those
near by, unless in front of the "business end."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
The crew stood close at hand as each round
was fired.</p>

<p>Before an unsophisticated onlooker would
imagine the great shell had reached its destination,
the wireless man, listening attentively to
the message from an aeroplane observer high
over the Huns, and out of our sight, sang out
"150 yards over."</p>

<p>A cabalistic sequence of numbers was shouted
in staccato tones by one of the non-coms,
repeated by a man at the breech, and flash!
bang! went "Mother" again.</p>

<p>"Well placed. Right into them," said the
wireless operator, as the approving message
was ticked from his fellow in the 'plane.</p>

<p>Flash! bang! the work went on, comforting
the battered men in our own trenches, and
harrying the Germans in theirs.</p>

<p>"Had nine direct hits on their trenches
yesterday," said the captain gunner, "and have
got the range pretty well to-day. Managed to
get a couple into one of the German batteries
this morning, too." And he grinned.</p>

<p>If the men who made the shells could have
known how much heart every 9·2 projectile
put into the brave boys that faced the Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
trenches, weary to distraction of everlasting
German shelling, and little return thereto, they
would have been justly proud of their handiwork.</p>

<p>A "Mother" shell was a fine tonic for those
who were behind it, "when it popped."</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th the 1st and 9th
Brigades "took over" the parts of the line held
by the 27th Division and most of that held by
the 28th. Up to that time the troopers had
been only in reserve or support, yet so heavy
was the Hun gun-fire in the Salient that our
Division had lost one officer killed and seventeen
wounded, and the casualty list among the
men was but few short of one hundred.</p>

<p>De Lisle was given command of a stretch of
line reaching from near the Bellewaarde Lake
to the Wieltje-St. Julien road, and 2,500 28th
Division men and all the guns east of the Yser-Ypres
Canal were placed under him. He at
once planned to throw several additional
batteries into the Salient, and gave orders
which would result in a shell-surprise for the
Huns. Every time the German gunners
started to shell our trenches, the German
trenches were to be deluged with a half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
hour of concentrated shell-fire from all de
Lisle's field batteries, his 6-inch howitzer
battery, and the single 60-pounder gun that
had been allotted to him.</p>

<p>The day closed with the repulse of the last
of three sanguine enemy attacks that had been
launched since morning, two of which had
gained a foothold in the British line, only to
have it, in each case, torn from their grasp by
costly counter-attacks.</p>

<p>The Ypres-Poperinghe road was filled with
troops marching westward. "To what lot do
these men belong?" I asked General Mullens,
as we stood watching the passing columns.</p>

<p>"They are of the Northumberland Brigade,"
said Mullens. "I am told that but 900 of
them are left out of more than 5,000. Another
Brigade went into the Salient 5,500 strong a
fortnight ago, and has come out to-day
numbering but 950."</p>

<p>I went to bed by the bright light of burning
Ypres, which made every tree cast flickering
shadows to try the nerves of the men who
tramped up in the cold darkness to share the
morrow's battle, or trudged back to billets to
sink into the torpor of extreme exhaustion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
until in their turn they should again face the
shattering shell blasts.</p>

<p>May 12th was comparatively a quiet day.
The wind had changed, and Hun gas attacks
were impossible until it again swung round to
the east.</p>

<p>I told Captain Francis Grenfell, of the 9th
Lancers, about the "Mother" gun not far
away, and we strolled down where it was
quartered just in time to watch it fire a score of
rounds at a German battery which was in
action at the bend of the Ypres-Comines Canal
near Hollebeke.</p>

<p>A second 9·2 gun had arrived in the night
and taken up quarters in an adjoining farm.
It had been doing good work near Brielen,
but was "spotted" by a German air-scout and
"found" by the enemy's guns. One man
killed and several wounded by a German shell
decided the gunner in command to "make a
get-away" from the discovered position.</p>

<p>The 3rd Cavalry Division troops were put
under de Lisle's command in addition to those
of his own Division and the odd brigades of
the 28th Division.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>11th, and retaken by a British counter-attack
that night, was rushed by the enemy on the
morning of the 12th and captured, only to have
another British counter-attack prepared for
the evening. Thus the line of battle surged
forward and backward day after day, each
section of trench being fought over time and
again with heavy losses to both sides.</p>

<p>Slowly the German circle was drawing closer
to the stricken town. The second battle of
Ypres was in full swing.</p>

<p>At lunch time General Allenby and his
Chief of Staff were guests of our mess. It was
a source of great satisfaction that the cavalry,
on the threshold of one of the hardest struggles
it had been called upon to face, should be
under a Corps Commander who had so long
been at its head as the G.O.C. of the Cavalry
Corps. No man that I saw in the months I
was with the British Expeditionary Force
inspired more confidence in his leadership than
Allenby.</p>

<p>General Meakin arrived from England, but
decided that the command of the 1st Cavalry
Brigade, to which he had been assigned, had
best be left in the hands of "Tommy" Pitman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
until its turn in the front trenches was done.
Pitman knew the ground and had a wonderful
grasp of the situation, and to no other one man
was due more of the credit for the holding of
the line during the ensuing forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>On the night of the 12th, the tired infantry
of the 28th Division was given relief from the
firing-line, and before dawn the two and a half
miles of front trenches, from the Canadian
Farm, north of the Ypres-St. Julien Road, south
to the western shore of the Bellewaard Lake,
a few yards from the Ypres-Menin Road at
Hooge, was manned by the dismounted troopers
of the 1st and 3rd Cavalry Divisions.</p>

<p>The 2nd Cavalry Brigade held the extreme
left of this stretch of cavalry line. The 18th
Hussars were furthest north, the 4th Dragoon
Guards in the centre, and the 9th Lancers on
right. South of them were the three regiments
of the 1st Cavalry Brigade&mdash;5th Dragoon
Guards, 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays),
and 11th Hussars. The 5th Dragoon Guards
were on the left of the Queen's Bays, whose
right rested on the Ypres-Zonnebeke Road
near Verlorenhoek, a thousand yards from
Potijze, where de Lisle so often took me each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
day. The 11th Hussars were in some trenches
near the grounds of the Potijze Château, The
9th Cavalry Brigade was in dug-outs near
Wieltje.</p>

<p>South of the Ypres-Zonnebeke Road came
the 3rd Cavalry Division front; the 7th Brigade
first, then the 6th Brigade, the 8th Brigade
being in reserve.</p>

<p>Of the 7th Brigade, the 1st Life Guards
formed the left, their trenches leading south
from the Zonnebeke Road. One of their
squadrons was in a reserve trench at the back
of the line. Next on the right came the
2nd Life Guards, then the Leicestershire
Yeomanry, whose right rested on the Ypres-Roulers
Railway.</p>

<p>The 6th Brigade held the line from the railway
to the Bellewarde Lake, the 3rd Dragoons
on the left, the North Somerset Yeomanry on
the right, and the 1st Royal Dragoons (Royals)
in reserve a bit to the rear, and but a few yards
north of the Menin road.</p>

<p>The 8th Brigade, in reserve, was composed
of the Royal Horse Guards (Blues), the
10th Hussars, and the Essex Yeomanry.</p>

<p>Each cavalry regiment had a fighting strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of about 300 men. The 1st Division numbered
some 2,400 rifles, and the 3rd Division roughly
2,700, say, just over 5,000 men for the two
Divisions. An extra number of machine-guns
made up for their comparatively small numerical
strength.</p>

<p>The trench-line into which the troopers were
thrown that night was in poor condition for
defence. A foot of mud was the average
bottom, and further attempts at digging only
resulted in more water and mud. Parapets of
sandbags and wire entanglements were sadly
needed all along the line, and, at that, sandbag
parapets were all too easily demolished by
Hun shell-fire, which made short work of them.</p>

<p>A careful reconnaissance of the 3rd Cavalry
Division trenches failed to reveal a stretch of
100 yards where more sandbags and more wire
were not urgently required.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">Dawn on the 13th of May was the
signal for a howitzer bombardment
of the cavalry front which surpassed
in intensity and duration any previous gun-fire
during the whole War.</p>

<p>From four o'clock in the morning until five
o'clock in the afternoon it drifted from one
section to another, without respite. During
the entire forenoon the trench line north and
south of the Zonnebeke Road, viewed from
Potijze, a thousand yards to the rear, was
covered continuously with a heavy pall of
smoke, as if a well-fed conflagration was raging
beneath. The flashes of bursting shells in that
smoke-cloud were so numerous that no human
eye could follow or count them, even in a most
restricted range of vision.</p>

<p>The sound was one grand, incessant roar.
All the thunderstorms of time, crashing in
splendid unison, would not have made a more
magnificent din. The ear could not intelligibly
record so tempestuous a maelstrom of sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>-waves,
and the brains of those in the midst of
its wildest fury became numb and indifferent to
the saturnalia of explosion, save for one here
and there which lost its mental balance, perhaps
never to be regained.</p>

<p>Early in the morning General de Lisle sent
me to Potijze with Captain Hardress Lloyd.
General Meakin rode up with us on his first
visit to the Salient since his return from sick
leave.</p>

<p>Ypres was impassable. We took a round-about
course to the north, now dashing down a
muddy lane, now over a turnip field where
constantly passing traffic had worn a sort of
path, over an improvised bridge across the
canal, at last reaching the Ypres-St. Jean Road
that led away to Wieltje and St. Julien. By a
cross road of sorts we found our way to Potijze,
thankful to have arrived safely.</p>

<p>Before we had traversed much of the way
from our headquarters, west of Ypres, we were
in a bad shell-zone. On the narrow road,
ammunition limbers went up at a trot and
returned at full gallop. The route was lined
with red-bandaged wounded struggling rearward
as best they could, and ambulances were
always in evidence. As we turned a corner a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Black Maria exploded with a fearful bang
fifty yards ahead, right beside the roadway.
A small piece of the shell hit General Meakin
in the head, but luckily was so spent it did not
cause a wound.</p>

<p>As we neared the canal blue ruin was spread
everywhere. Battery on battery of our artillery,
firing like mad, barked and roared from the
fields at our sides, while Hun shells fell close
and fast around them.</p>

<p>A car dashed towards us, the chauffeur
holding up his hand to stop us. It was "Babe"
Nicholson's car, empty except for the driver,
whom Nicholson had told to "look out for
himself," while "Babe" was showing the way
trenchwards to a depleted battalion of York
and Durham Territorials sent forward as
reserve. Only 380 of their 1,000 remained
from the fortnight's fighting and sixteen of
their officers had been killed or wounded, but
they trudged up as if arriving fresh from home.</p>

<p>"Stop, sir," said the scared chauffeur. "They
are shelling the road beyond so heavily no one
can get through."</p>

<p>"Did you just come through?" asked
Hardress Lloyd.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the boy; "but a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
almost lit on me. One of them blew the car
into the hedge."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, President," said Lloyd grimly.
"We have got to get there somehow."</p>

<p>We got there, somehow.</p>

<p>Once we ran through the ill-smelling shell-cloud
of a coal-box that burst a few yards in
front of us, and twigs from the trees fell over
the car as the shells screamed above, but
we dodged on, past shell-holes and around
barricades, untouched.</p>

<p>Pulling up, I saw Nicholson's car behind us,
the driver grinning.</p>

<p>"I thought if it was good enough for you it
was good enough for me," he said. "But I'm
hanged if I thought <em>anyone</em> could get over that
road and not be hit. It's the first time I've
been up here."</p>

<p>I introduced him to my tiny Potijze dug-out,
which he thought "smelled horrid." He was
inclined to a preference for the open air until a
great howitzer-shell lit fifty feet away, pieces
from it knocking over some of the wall of the
ruined house behind which the dug-out had
been made. As he joined me in the cramped
space below ground another Black Maria burst
across the road from us, making the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
tremble and showering splinters on the roof of
our shelter.</p>

<p>Fortunately for those whose work took them
over the roads that morning the sky was leaden
and rain fell at intervals, rendering German
aeroplane observation impossible. Had a
Hun airman caught sight of the traffic-filled
road over which we had come the enemy
gunners might have effectually closed it to
traffic.</p>

<p>As we waited at Potijze the shells from the
British guns behind us seemed to fill the air.
Gradually the fire of the German howitzers
concentrated on the trench-line in front of us,
and the Boche gunners burst shrapnel all
about the fields, searching erratically for the
English batteries.</p>

<p>Budworth, of the artillery, was very much
upset that morning by the target selected by
one of the British howitzers.</p>

<p>Our divisional batteries H, I, and the
Warwickshire Territorial Battery, were doing
fine work and splendid execution.</p>

<p>Budworth's observers sent back word that
some of our heavy guns were shelling a farm
that he had instructed should not be shelled
by his batteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly he sent to the howitzer commander
and asked him to "Please get off that farm."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?" asked the howitzer
man. "It's in German hands, right enough."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Budworth. "But
I've figured out that the Hun Artillery
Commander would have his headquarters
about there; very probably in that very farm.
The old chap is peppering my batteries with
shrapnel, which don't bother us, for we just get
in our funk-holes and wait until it's all over,
then run out and bang away. For that matter
we don't even go in for it, if we are busy. If
the old Boche chap who is running their guns
should be killed by one of your big shells, and
another German beggar, who decided to use
high explosives on us, should take his place,
we couldn't stay here long. Whatever you
do, don't bother the old German gunner-chap.
He is quite all right, from our standpoint,
where he is at present."</p>

<p>Budworth's theory was proven sound by the
fact that out of his three batteries of field guns
he only lost eleven men and ten horses in a
fortnight of fighting.</p>

<p>Standing in the Zonnebeke Road and looking
toward Verlorenhoek, the shell-swept front line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
was plainly visible, a little more than half a
mile away.</p>

<p>To reconstruct a fight on a two-and-a-half
mile front such as the battle of May 13th, with
official regimental reports to which to refer,
would be sufficiently difficult. To piece it out
while it was actually in progress was increasingly
so.</p>

<p>I ran back and forth from our headquarters
west of Ypres to the town of Potijze many
times that day. By evening, when I left the
Salient for the night, I had met with scores
who had terrible tales to tell. The wounded
made an unending stream westwards, and
numbered many a familiar face.</p>

<p>Officers and men all declared the shell-fire
was the heaviest they had seen. At no point
in the line was the German shelling more fierce
than on either side the Zonnebeke Road, near
Verlorenhoek. The Queen's Bays were to the
north of it, the 5th D.G.'s on their left. On
the south of the road were the 1st Life Guards,
and on their right the 2nd Life Guards, then
the Leicestershire Yeomanry.</p>

<p>The Bays, under Lieutenant-Colonel "Algy"
Lawson, formerly of the Greys, held on like
grim death in spite of the storm of shell that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
burst over them at four o'clock in the morning
and continued hour after hour throughout the
day.</p>

<p>The Life Guards were driven back from
their trenches with heavy losses, and the
Leicestershire Yeomanry had to fall back as
well.</p>

<p>This exposed the right flank of the Bays,
but still they stuck to their position.</p>

<p>At about half past ten o'clock the commanding
officer of the 5th D.G.'s ordered the
retirement of his regiment, the men trickling
back in two thin lines, one at either end of
their section of front.</p>

<p>This resulted in the left of the Bays being
uncovered as well as their right, but they put
their teeth in and held on. The 11th Hussars
came up magnificently on the left shortly after,
and shared the glory, with the Bays, of saving
the line.</p>

<p>Twice during the day the Huns formed for
an infantry attack in front of the Bays, and
each time our splendid guns were told of the
concentration, and poured shell into the massing
Germans with terrible execution, scattering
the enemy detachments like chaff before the
wind, and thus nipping the attack in the bud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>A strong enemy detachment came down the
Zonnebeke Road and deployed to the north
of it, immediately in front of the Bays. The
Boches were lying in the open, but were
protected from our rifle and machine-gun fire
by a swell of ground.</p>

<p>A fat German observation officer obtained a
place of vantage in a shattered farmhouse just
south of the road. No amount of sniping could
dislodge him, though the bullets chipped off
bits of brick from the slender stack behind
which he was sheltered. Up came a Naval
Division armoured Rolls-Royce. Opposite the
end of the Bays' trenches it stopped and
opened fire.</p>

<p>The Hun officer in the farm noted the
approach of the car, and fled up the road as
fast as he could run.</p>

<p>"I had to laugh so much at the funny figure
the little fat chap cut, with the tails of his long
grey coat flapping straight out behind him as
he ran," said one of the Bays to me that night.
"I swear it did in any chance I had of hitting
him. He got back to his own lot safe, I
think, but he did made a holy show of himself
doing it."</p>

<p>A large number of the enemy were seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
concentrating in a wood in front of the Bays
toward evening, and again word to our gunners
was followed by a bombardment of the group
of trees that made immediate evacuation of it
the only alternative to sure death.</p>

<p>On the extreme left of the cavalry line, the
18th Hussars suffered more heavily than the
other regiments of the 2nd Brigade, though
the 9th Lancers had many casualties.</p>

<p>The trenches occupied by the 18th Hussars
were blown to bits. Some of the regiment
retired to the left into the adjacent trenches of
the East Lancashire, and some went back over
the open ground in search of the reserve
trenches. Failing to find them, the troopers
advanced to the ruins of their own line and dug
themselves in as best they could, only to be blown
out of some parts of the trenches a second time.</p>

<p>The Hospital Corps men could not reach the
18th wounded, as the Huns had a machine-gun
trained on the only approach to the trenches.
Consequently many men, unable to be moved
to a place of safety, were killed as they lay
wounded in trench or dug-out.</p>

<p>The right of the cavalry line, from the
Ypres-Roulers Railway toward the Menin
Road, was in very soft ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The 3rd Dragoon Guards, North Somerset
Yeomanry, and Royals, of General David
Campbell's 6th Brigade, were literally picked
up and thrown back by the howitzer shells,
while the line was simply blotted out of
existence.</p>

<p>The Royals, in reserve, made a charge at
7.30 in the morning that took them to the
place where the original trenches had been, but
all that remained of them, even at that early
hour, were great tumbled piles of earth and
mud without semblance of form.</p>

<p>Cecil Howard, Campbell's Brigade Major,
was the only officer on the 6th Brigade Staff
who was not hit, Campbell himself being
slightly wounded.</p>

<p>The most spectacular manœuvre of the day
fell to the lot of Bulkeley Johnson's 8th Brigade,
who were taken from reserve to counter-attack
at 2.30 p.m. and win back the part of the line
out of which Kennedy's 7th Brigade, the 1st
and 2nd Life Guards, and the Leicestershire
Yeomanry had been shelled.</p>

<p>The area to be won back reached from the
Ypres-Zonnebeke Road to the Ypres-Roulers
Railway. On the left of it the gallant Bays
had stuck to their trenches. On the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
it, David Campbell's men were holding on,
though frightfully decimated; their left, resting
on the railway, bent back slightly by the retirement
of the 7th Brigade.</p>

<p>The British artillery opened the 2.30 attack
in splendid style. Then up went the 8th Brigade,
Blues, 10th Hussars, and Essex Yeomanry.</p>

<p>It made the pulses beat high to hear the
story of that charge from the Bays, who had
reserved seats for the show.</p>

<p>The lines swept forward with a cheer that
was drowned in the crashing of the shells.
The Blues reached the line of shell-holes that
marked the position of the Life Guards'
trenches. No cover was to be found. So on
they went, a few of them actually penetrating
the German trenches 400 yards beyond, but
soon realizing that their numbers were insufficient
to maintain their position, and slowly
coming back with what was left of their regiment.
The 10th Hussars went up invincibly,
men dropping at every step. One big trooper
was seen advancing some distance ahead of his
comrades, those who had been in line with him
at the start all down. He stalked along coolly,
without waiting for the others. The big trooper
made a gallant showing, standing for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and firing steadily, then tramping on, to stop
and fire again. No one dreamed he would
reach the Hun trenches alive, but he did so,
and was the first of the 10th Hussars to disappear
over the enemy's parapet.</p>

<p>Had the Germans stuck to their trenches
the few of the 10th to reach them might easily
have been wiped out. But the Teuton soldiers
fled before that stern advance.</p>

<p>Like the Blues, the 10th Hussars were too
few to be able to consolidate the small portion
of enemy trench which they had won, so nothing
remained but a retirement.</p>

<p>Back they came, the Hun supports quickly
taking advantage of their withdrawal. Two
armoured cars pushed beyond the Bays' trench,
up the Zonnebeke Road, and poured a heavy
machine-gun fire across the rear of the retreating
10th Hussars' line. Few of that regiment
would have returned had this covering fire not
protected their retirement.</p>

<p>Once a group of troopers took a few dozen
German prisoners, but the captured Huns were
nearly all killed by German shell-fire before
they could be taken to a place of safety. No
trenches existed in that area into which to put
them, and English and German, captors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
prisoners alike, were mowed down by Hun
shrapnel as they crossed the fields towards
Potijze.</p>

<p>Months after that memorable battle, I had
sent to me by a friend, a distinguished officer
in the 11th Hussars, some leaves from his War
diary. His account of the operations of his
regiment that day read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thursday, May 13th.&mdash;At about four a.m.
a terrific bombardment began against our front
line trenches. The fire was most intense, and
heavier even than at Messines. At 7.30 a.m.
Brigade Headquarters received a message from
the 5th D.G.'s, saying that a great deal of
their trenches had been blown in, and that
their position was critical. The troops of C
Squadron, 11th Hussars, under Norrie, were
ordered up to support them. There was no
communication trench to the front line, but by
clever use of the ground they reached the
5th D.G.'s with very few casualties. The
bombardment still increased. The Bays were
holding on as well, but asked for more ammunition.
A party from Renton's troop succeeded
in getting some up, but had several killed in
doing so. About 12 o'clock a regiment of the
3rd Cavalry Division, on the right of the Bays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
were shelled out of their trenches, and the
Germans succeeded in getting a footing in
them. General Briggs ordered a counter-attack,
which was launched at 2.30 p.m.
Renton, who had been twice up to the front
line to get information for the Brigadier,
volunteered to lead the 10th Hussars up to
the Bays' right, where they were to commence
their attack. The whole affair was carried out
like an Aldershot parade movement. The
men screamed at the top of their voices, the
officers making hunting noises, as they all
charged across the open. It was a glorious
sight. The Germans ran as if the devil himself
was after them, our guns pouring shrapnel
into them. The trenches were retaken, but in
the excitement the attackers rushed on another
half a mile.</p>

<p>"The Germans then turned on all their
artillery, killing their own men as well as ours.
Confusion followed, and the attacking line, being
broken up, withdrew about half a mile. It was
a pity they ever went beyond their original
line, as the casualties were heavy.</p>

<p>"To return to our own section of the line.
The 5th D.G.'s reported that they had put
Norrie's troop into their front line, keeping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
other troop (Sergeant Lemon) in a support
trench. Their casualties had been heavy, and
the situation extremely critical. During the
afternoon information came in that the whole
of the 5th D.G.'s had been shelled out of their
trenches, and were retiring. Shortly after this
Lance-Corporal Watts came back from the
front line with a message from Norrie, explaining
the situation. He had held on with his
troop when the 5th D.G.'s retired, and besides
his own men had a troop of the 5th and one of
their machine-guns, and was covering the left
flank of the Bays&mdash;a grand piece of work. The
line had to be held at all cost, so the 11th
Hussars were ordered to advance and retake
the lost trenches. Lawson's Squadron (A)
was sent in advance, with instructions to work
up behind the Bays, and push in on their left.
Later, another message came in to say that a
squadron of the 19th Hussars, under Tremayne,
had pushed up to Norrie and had been put on
his left; however, there still existed a considerable
gap of unoccupied trench. Divine
Providence must have come to our aid, as the
shelling practically stopped as the regiment
advanced. Soon after 6 p.m. Brigade Headquarters
heard that Lawson had successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
got his squadron up to the front line. B
Squadron, Stewart Richardson, followed on,
and by dusk the line was re-established.</p>

<p>"Our casualties for the day were about fifty,
the Bays had the same, and the 5th D.G.'s had
over one hundred, a large number of which,
however, occurred during the retirement. As
the sun was setting the battle died down. It
had been a nerve-straining day, full of gallant
episodes."</p>
</div>

<p>Wires cut, messengers killed, and the inevitable
and exaggerated and mistaken reports
of the wounded, made the long day of fighting
an anxious one at de Lisle's headquarters.</p>

<p>The day's casualties in the 1st and 3rd
Cavalry Divisions were thought, until well into
the following day, to exceed fifty per cent. of
the men engaged.</p>

<p>Early in the forenoon came word that
"Hardly any of the 3rd D.G.'s and the North
Somerset Yeomanry are left." At midday
Colonel Burnett and Major Corbett, of the
18th Hussars, were reported killed, but two or
three hours later we learned the news, while
unfortunately true as to Major Corbett, was
incorrect as to Burnett, who was sound and
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>At 4 p.m. General de Lisle sent me to
Colonel Browne, the Chief Medical Officer of
the 1st Cavalry Division, to ascertain what was
actually known as to officer casualties in the
Division.</p>

<p>Colonel Browne said: "We cannot get the
ambulances up yet to evacuate the wounded,
the shell-fire so covers the roads. Thus far
but eight of our wounded officers have been
brought back."</p>

<p>Among the eight was Major Sewell, of the
4th D.G.'s. The 9th Lancers, Sewell thought,
had suffered from the shell-fire even more
heavily than the 18th Hussars.</p>

<p>As I was about to leave Potijze, at seven
o'clock that night, a staff officer reported that
General Kennedy had just told him but ninety
men were left to him out of his fine 7th Brigade,
and he greatly feared that a large proportion,
if not all, of the missing were killed or
wounded.</p>

<p>General Briggs, at Potijze, received report
after report of heavy losses from the various
3rd Cavalry Division units, as dark drew
on, until it seemed that the Division had
been practically wiped out. But 200 men
were reported to be left to Campbell of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
6th Brigade. Kennedy's 7th Brigade mustered
120 at the close of the day, and Bulkeley
Johnson's 8th Brigade was so shattered that
to obtain an estimate of its numbers was most
difficult.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the 6th, 7th, and
8th Brigades had, according to all military
theory, ceased to exist as fighting forces, their
remnants were gathered together as best the
darkness of the night allowed, and put hard at
work "digging themselves in," in preparation
for the fight that the morning light would be
sure to bring them.</p>

<p>The Northumberland Territorial Brigade,
its numbers raised to 1,200, was sent up to
help the tired troopers dig. Their General,
Fielding, an old Aisne acquaintance, lunched
with us that day. He had just taken over
their command, as their former Brigadier had
been killed a fortnight before in the Salient.
The transformation of that lot of Terriers from
raw, untried troops to veterans of shell-warfare
had not taken many days.</p>

<p>Captain Johnson, a French liaison officer
who had been attached to General Briggs' staff
since Mons, and who had won the respect and
deep affection of all with whom he came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
contact, was shot through the head and
instantly killed that night as he was accompanying
General Briggs on a tour of the
trenches in front of Potijze.</p>

<p>Wilson's 4th Division, on the left of the 1st
Cavalry Division, which had also suffered
heavily on the 13th, had sent a message asking
the cavalry to take over some of its line, but
that night it found it possible to occupy a few
hundred yards of the line held by the 18th
Hussars. This proved a most welcome
assistance. The right of the 3rd Cavalry
Division front, from the Ypres-Roulers Railway
to the Menin Road, was given into the hands
of the Irish Fusiliers, of the 27th Division.</p>

<p>The line, thus shortened slightly, was the
scene of feverish work all night long, that the
importance of the small German gain might be
minimised, and a further Hun advance blocked.</p>

<p>The actual ground gained by the Germans
on May 13th was but 300 to 400 yards on a
front of 1,000 yards. Our new line from the
Zonnebeke Road across the Ypres-Roulers
railway was in better terrain than the old
position, and offered superior natural advantages
for defence to the deplorable original
line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>So we were far from disheartened when day
broke on May 14th.</p>

<p>The German heavy guns had seemed at times
during the 13th to number scores on scores.
Though fire came from every direction into
the badly placed and rottenly made British
trenches, blowing our thin line sky-high all
along the front, the net result of advantage to
the enemy was extremely small.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th de Lisle said to
me: "Bad as our losses have been, I have the
situation in hand. The men have held the line,
and will continue to do so. Every hour sees
things get better."</p>

<p>The shattered, depleted, almost anihilated
regiments of the day before were found by the
grey light of that cold, rainy May morning to
be fighting forces still, their moral undamaged,
and their spirits undimmed.</p>

<p>By half past six o'clock I was off for Potijze
with de Lisle, a heavy rain during the night
having covered the road with slimy mud and
made it terribly slippery. We found Hun
gunners so docile that I could with impunity
run the general to the G.H.Q. line on the
Potijze road.</p>

<p>As I waited in the roadway two of the Blues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
came past. Mud-covered and battle-stained,
they slouched along as if completely tired out.</p>

<p>"Good morning," I called out, cheerily.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir," they answered,
straightening, instinctively, as they spoke.
Fine chaps they were, and soldierly from head
to foot, in spite of the mantle of dirt in which
they were wrapped.</p>

<p>Nerves and muscles relaxed, almost at the
limit of endurance, steeped in physical fatigue,
like a flash they could pull up, eyes clear,
heads erect, voices firm, the look on their faces
showing that they were just as good fighting
men at that moment as they were thirty-six
hours previously.</p>

<p>Over the smoke of welcome cigarettes we
chatted of the charge of the day before. The
rushing of the German trenches, the capture
of a section of them, and then being overpowered
and turned out by overwhelming numbers of
Huns, was gone over, spiritedly, by the
troopers.</p>

<p>"Only seventy of the Blues are left, though,"
said one of them. "That's the hard part
of it."</p>

<p>"You are sure to find more when things get
straightened out," I replied. "Casualty lists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
always grow smaller when the returns are all
in."</p>

<p>They trudged on soberly, "Hoping so."
Splendid men.</p>

<p>I was sent to search the houses in Potijze,
or what was left of them, for a couple of
wounded officers who were reported to be
waiting to be evacuated by an ambulance that
had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>An Essex Yeomanry trooper limped slowly
passed as I started, and I gave him a "lift"
for a few hundred yards. He had badly
sprained his knee during the charge the day
before. By morning it had become so swollen
and painful he could only hobble along with
great difficulty. No thought of coming back
to have it attended to, after the charge, had
entered his mind.</p>

<p>"We were told to hang on till dark," he
explained, "and it took all of us that were left
to hang on. I couldn't have come back very
well, could I?"</p>

<p>Before the day was over some of the official
casualty lists of the brigades were compiled,
and we were greatly cheered to find the losses
were less heavy than had at first been reported.</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division casualties for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
May 13th numbered 523. In the 1st Cavalry
Brigade two officers were killed and five
wounded, and 164 troopers killed or wounded.
The 2nd Cavalry Brigade had a casualty list
of 249. Three officers in the brigade were
killed and eleven wounded. Among the killed
was Lieutenant Lunan, a very brave medical
officer attached to the 9th Lancers. The
18th Hussars lost 160, the 9th Lancers 140,
and the 4th D.G.'s thirty-five.</p>

<p>The 3rd Cavalry Division suffered more
heavily. David Campbell's 6th Brigade had
eleven officers killed and twenty-two wounded&mdash;thirty-three
out of a total of forty-nine. In the
ranks, the Royals lost 117, the North Somerset
Yeomanry 105, and the 3rd Dragoon Guards
sixty-nine. The total for the brigade was
330 casualties. The 7th Brigade lost over
450 officers and men. Seven Leicestershire
Yeomanry officers were killed and five were
wounded. In the ranks, the Leicestershires
had 180 casualties, making a total of over 190,
all told, out of a strength of 300. The 8th
Brigade's list of over 300 brought the total of
killed and wounded for the 3rd Division to
more than 1,100.</p>

<p>A patrol of 15th Hussars, under Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Kenneth Maclane, while the regiment was
holding a part of the line to the north of
Verlorenhoek, went up to the German first
line trenches during the afternoon and found
a section of them deserted, which showed the
Huns were little better satisfied with the
strategical location of their line than we had
been with parts of ours.</p>

<p>Visits to Potijze from time to time meant
coming close to big shell-bursts, but the fury of
the 13th had made the itinerant shell-fire of the
14th so insignificant in contrast that we paid
little attention to even the biggest of the Black
Marias.</p>

<p>That night the 2nd Cavalry Division, General
Kavanaugh commanding, relieved the 1st and
3rd Divisions on a narrowed front, the infantry
closing in on the sides. Before morning of the
15th our tired men were on their way back to
billets for a well-earned rest.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En route</i> from Potijze to our headquarters at
dusk on the 14th, my despatch case fell from
the car. I went over the road carefully at daylight
the following morning, and only desisted
in my futile search when the "morning hate"
made it foolish to tarry longer in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Great was my delight during the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to learn that a wire had been received at
Divisional headquarters, saying that, "amongst
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> on the battlefield had been found a
despatch case belonging to Frederic Coleman."
A gunner of H Battery, R.H.A., had spied
it in a roadside ditch in the Salient, and
thoughtfully taken it to Major Skinner, commanding
the battery, who had at once advised
us of its recovery.</p>

<p>On the night of May 15th and morning of
May 16th, General Hubert Gough's 7th
Infantry Division made a splendid "push" to
La Quinque Rue, in front of Festubert, the
report of which made cheery reading.</p>

<p>The men of the 1st Cavalry Division were
housed in "huts" near Vlamertinghe. On
the 16th General de Lisle addressed the contingents,
one after another. He asked me to
verify one or two details that had been
reported, and this work gave me a most
pleasant couple of hours chatting about the
battle of May 13th with men of half a dozen
of the different regiments that took part in it.</p>

<p>The evening of the 17th found the 1st
Cavalry Division, after seventy-two hours' rest,
again marching through Ypres to take a further
turn in the trenches.</p>

<p>The Salient had been comparatively quiet
since the last German onslaught on the 13th,
but howitzer shells were daily falling over the
lines with tiresome regularity.</p>

<p>I was sent by General de Lisle to a house
near Ypres, where we had planned to have
a "basket dinner" before leaving for night
quarters on the Menin Road. A very young
staff-officer, instructed to guide me, misunderstood
that such duty was required of him, and
went off about some business of his own before
I had been able to learn the location of the
house.</p>

<p>Meeting "Rattle" Barrett, I asked him if
he could give me the desired information.</p>

<p>"I don't know about the dinner part of it,"
said "Rattle"; but your headquarters for the
night are well east of Ypres, on the Menin
Road. Go to the house nearest the château
that stands by the Halte, where the railway
crosses the road, and you can't miss it if you
try.</p>

<p>The General had disappeared on foot, the
juvenile staff-officer was nowhere to be found,
so off I went, in accordance with Barrett's
instructions.</p>

<p>Darkness was coming on. I passed along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
lines of 2nd Cavalry Brigade troopers, marching
toward Ypres and through it.</p>

<p>No lights were allowed, though my car was
secure from liability of offence in that particular,
for the electric installation had gone wrong, a
not infrequent occurrence, and no one but
a master electrician could coax a glimmer out
of the headlamps.</p>

<p>Bump! Bump! I jolted from hole to hole
in the smashed roadway. The streets were
crowded with the machinery of the divisional
relief in full swing. Ypres seemed more
smashed, if possible, than when we had last
passed through six days before. From the
Grande Place down the Rue de Menin, to the
bridge and Menin Road beyond, and well out
past the fork, where the roads branched to
Zonnebeke and Menin respectively, the path
was narrow and tortuous. Piled high on either
hand were heaps of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>, alternated with
chasms, some sufficiently deep so that a fall
to the bottom would put a car promptly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors
de combat</i>.</p>

<p>An unpleasant smell of burning flesh came
from the smouldering mounds lining the way.</p>

<p>Star-shells and trench lights from the firing
line made it possible to see the road. Save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
for their assistance I could not have made the
journey without accident.</p>

<p>The house where we were to spend the next
few days was easily found. The officers of the
80th Infantry Brigade were busy in it arranging
reliefs when I arrived.</p>

<p>A house of stout brick, badly scarred and
knocked about, covered a cellar, low roofed
and filled with foul air, but reasonably safe
from shell-fire.</p>

<p>In this underground sanctuary the flickering
light of a dozen candles fell on crowded tables
for signallers, around which the men not busy
with 'phone or ticker were asleep, heads
resting on their crossed arms. Officers pored
over maps spread on other tables, or were
engaged in close attention to the receipt or
despatch of innumerable orders. Against one
wall were three or four bedsteads, covered with
mattresses that had borne the wearied forms of
a long succession of British fighting men, from
general officers to privates, and bore ample
evidences of having done so.</p>

<p>A battery of British guns were firing from
a position near by, and German shells were
bursting close enough to cause an interruption
of a conversation by their constant crashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>No news could I find of General de Lisle
until Captain Webb, of the Signal Corps,
arrived.</p>

<p>"The General?" he said in reply to my
query. "I think the General is in a house on
the right of the road as you leave Ypres on the
west."</p>

<p>I lost no time in getting under way. The
return journey was like a bad dream. Shells
fell in the vicinity of the road, but not so near
as to damage the steadily flowing river of
troops, ammunition and food transport, horse
and mechanical; ambulances, motor-cycles, and
once, another car.</p>

<p>A fatiguing house-to-house search landed me
at the spot where dinner had been. Orders
left for me instructed me to bring various
impedimenta to the Menin Road; so, for the
third time, I ploughed through Ypres and
toward the Halte, where at last I found de Lisle.
Nor was that by any means the last trip over
that route that I was to make that night. But
enough of motoring troubles.</p>

<p>On the 18th it rained with dour persistency.</p>

<p>The 1st Cavalry Division line ran south from
the Ypres-Roulers railway, past the west shore
of the Bellewaarde Lake. It dipped south-east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
around the ruins of the Hooge Château and to
the east of where Hooge once stood. Crossing
the Menin Road, the front threaded the
Sanctuary Wood, on the eastern edge of which
the enemy were entrenched.</p>

<p>The position in the Sanctuary Wood was
the extreme easterly promontory of the Ypres
Salient, and not many yards west of the line
which the 1st Cavalry Division held in February
and March.</p>

<p>General de Lisle's cellar headquarters were
less than 2,000 yards from the nearest front-line
trench, and Hooge itself was not much further
distant.</p>

<p>In an adjacent farm, which had been
abandoned for many days, dead cattle and
chickens lay about the yard. The table in the
living room showed the family had decamped
at meal time, evidently hurried by a shell which
shaved a corner off the house. They left
without waiting to gather up any of their simple
belongings.</p>

<p>The lonely cows ambled inquisitively toward
me, and were evidently greatly appreciative of
a thorough milking, though few cared to drink
milk from cows pastured in that poisoned zone,
where every inch of ground was septic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>On a dash through Ypres at daybreak I
again saw the poor hunted collie. Many
mongrels thereabouts were frankly glad of a
kind word and a pat on the head, but the high-bred,
beautiful collie, his splendid coat matted
and bedraggled, was so thoroughly frightened
that all my efforts to get close to him were
fruitless. It was wicked to leave him to death
by a chance shell, and more than one of us
risked carrying away a shell-souvenir in a vain
attempt to save him.</p>

<p>At an early hour de Lisle said: "Find a
shelter of some sort for your car, President.
Don't forget that the Germans turn their shells
down this road a bit at times."</p>

<p>A search resulted in the discovery of a
maltster's, where some push-cyclists attached
to a battalion of King's Royal Rifles cordially
offered to make room for my battered conveyance.
A passing ammunition train the night
before had ripped off a front mud-guard, and a
horse ambulance had crumpled one of the rear
guards, while a transport mule had endeavoured
to climb into the tonneau, to the sad detriment
of my folded cape hood.</p>

<p>I never met a more cheery lot than those
K.R.R. cyclists, who generously insisted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
my sharing a tin of steaming hot tea and
warming myself at their comfortable fire.
They showed me a pump in the ruins
of a house adjoining, enabling me to get
a rare wash, and a still rarer shave, giving
me a quite respectable appearance in comparison
with my comrades of the 1st Cavalry
Division Staff.</p>

<p>During the morning the General sent me to
a riddled château not far distant, where General
Mullens had placed 2nd Cavalry Brigade headquarters.
An attempt to use the remains of
the drawing-room as a more comfortable habitation
than the cellar, was abandoned during
the day, as coal-boxes fell with annoying
regularity in the château yard.</p>

<p>A call at the headquarters of General
Arbuthnot, C.R.A. of the 28th Division, in a
house west of Ypres, found my lost despatch
case had been sent there by Skinner of H
Battery, to whom General Arbuthnot had
kindly wired offering to keep it until I could
call and reclaim it.</p>

<p>At Arbuthnot's headquarters I met a captain
of his staff, who had been a military attaché
in China before the Boxer troubles in 1900,
and who knew many of the acquaintances I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
had made when campaigning with General
Gaselee in the war with China.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, I mentioned
the prevailing belief in many quarters that
unwritten truces existed between British and
German gunners with regard to shelling certain
areas. I instanced Dickebusch, a continual
home of one of our divisional headquarters,
which had been unshelled until our guns
hammered a town in the German lines where
Hun headquarters were thought to have been
located, and thereafter was inundated with a
steady rain of shell-fire for many days.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Some peculiar things of that sort have
happened," said the Captain. "The Divisional
headquarters to which I was recently
attached, occupied, near the line, a château
which for months had not been visited by a
German shell. I became possessed with the
idea, without any real evidence to which to
attribute it, that so long as our lot did not shell
the Hollebeke Château, our house would be
free from a Hun shelling. The Hollebeke
Château was in the German lines, and while
I did not, of course, know positively, I felt sure
it contained some German brigade or divisional
headquarters. Many a time our batteries fired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
at enemy batteries on all sides of the Hollebeke
Château, but not once was it made a target by
our gunners.</p>

<p>"For week after week this condition of
affairs continued, and was often the subject
of comment among us. Naturally, in the
absence of communication of any sort between
the opposing forces, all this may have been
mere coincidence.</p>

<p>"One day, returning from a walk, I entered
the drive to our château just as Hun shells
began to rain upon us. The shrapnel came
thick and fast for several minutes, and the
Divisional Commander and some of his staff
officers had very narrow escapes. One shrapnel
bullet passed through a wall only ten or twelve
inches from the General's head.</p>

<p>"None of our divisional guns had been firing
for some hours, but another battery in the
vicinity had been doing quite a bit of shelling
that morning. Curious, I asked the aeroplane
observer who had been directing the fire of
that battery what target he had given them.</p>

<p>"'I went up to direct their fire on some
German guns reported to be near the Hollebeke
Château,' the observer told me. 'I couldn't
locate the described spot, so directed our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
battery to throw a few shells into the château
itself. Our gunners at once registered one
lyddite through the roof and four shells right
through the face of the building. I'll bet we
made it hot for any Boches that were inside.'</p>

<p>"Comparing times," continued the Captain,
"I learned that the Hollebeke Château received
its shelling exactly ten minutes before our headquarters
château was shelled by the Huns.
What made the incident more curious was the
fact that for weeks our batteries did no more
damage to the Hollebeke Château and never
again, at least until I left it, did our château
have a German shell near it."</p>
</div>

<p>The rain softened the earth about the dug-outs
in front of Ypres, and soon an epidemic of
caved-in sides and roofs was raging all along
the line, assisted by Black Marias, which shook
the moist ground until dug-out supports fell and
walls collapsed wholesale. A captain of the
18th Hussars was in a dug-out roofed by an
iron bedstead. A small landslide brought down
the beams above and the bedstead fell, so
striking the Hussar officer that his neck was
broken and he was instantly killed.</p>

<p>The 19th, 20th, and 21st of May passed
quickly, the three brigades of the Division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
changing from front line to support dug-outs
and back again in relays as the days succeeded
each other.</p>

<p>On the 21st the sun came out, bright and
strong, and justified a few minutes' delay <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</i> through Ypres to obtain some photographs.
The town was sadly depressing. Earthquake
and conflagration might produce as much ruin,
but could hardly arrange it so fantastically.</p>

<p>In Ypres Madame Caprice came hand
in hand with Devastation and Death. In
diabolical mood she flung the shattered buildings
of the staid old town hither and thither
with an eye to the spectacular. The grotesque
met one's glance on every side. Only a James
Pryde could have done justice on canvas to
such a scene.</p>

<p>After a thunderstorm of almost tropical
intensity on the night of the 21st, the 1st
Cavalry Division troopers were relieved, and
soon after daylight were sleeping soundly in the
huts and the adjacent farms near Vlamertinghe.
The 22nd and 23rd of May they spent in
resting, and on the evening of the 23rd again
went back into the trench line.</p>

<p>General de Lisle returned for his rest to
new quarters at Esquelbecq, in a thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
century château which boasted the honour of
having once been stormed by Marlborough.</p>

<p>The 14th Division of the "K" Army was
billeted near Esquelbecq, and had been placed
in the newly formed 6th Corps. Allenby's
5th Corps then consisted of the 28th Division,
9th Division (the first of the "K" Divisions to
arrive in France), and the Northumberland
Territorial Division. The 6th Corps, containing
the 4th Division, the 27th Division,
and the new 14th Division was placed under
the command of General Keir.</p>

<p>On the evening of May 23rd, while the
troopers of the 1st, 2nd and 9th Cavalry
Brigades tramped through Ypres once more,
and took over part of the sodden trench-line
of the Salient, General de Lisle again took up
headquarters in the big château not far west of
the demolished town.</p>

<p>The Salient front trenches led over the line
that was taken up after the reconstruction
following the hard fighting on May 13th.
Wilson's 4th Division reached from the French
right, near the Ypres-Yser Canal on the north,
to the Canadian Farm, then past the Ypres-Passchendaele
Road to the Ypres-Zonnebeke
Road near Verlorenhoek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Zonnebeke Road south, across the
Ypres-Roulers Railway, as far as the Bellewaarde
Lake, troops of the 28th Division
composed the firing line.</p>

<p>They joined the left flank of the 18th
Hussars, who occupied a position on the south
side of the Bellewaarde Lake and in front of
the Hooge Château, the trenches at that point
being about thirty yards to the east of the
château ruins. The right of the 18th Hussars
rested on the Menin Road, and close behind
them in reserve were three score odd York
and Durham Tommies who had been sent up
to dig.</p>

<p>South of the Menin Road, in the Sanctuary
Wood, came the 9th Lancers, 11th Hussars,
Queen's Bays, and 5th Dragoon Guards,
respectively.</p>

<p>The 4th Dragoon Guards, 15th Hussars,
and 19th Hussars were in reserve in the
G.H.Q. line.</p>

<p>The night was less disturbed by gun-fire
than usual, and even the rifle fire and itinerant
sniping were of less volume than for weeks past.</p>

<p>General de Lisle, noticing the strong westerly
breeze die away, and the wind shift to the east
during the course of the afternoon, sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
warning to the troops in the trenches to be on
the look out for a German gas attack next
morning.</p>

<p>At earliest light on Whit Monday, the 24th
of May, the Hun gas came.</p>

<p>Before three o'clock in the morning, the
yellow-green haze was drifting slowly on the
light breezes that heralded the coming of the
dawn.</p>

<p>Over the eastern front of the Salient the
smoke-cloud came from near Wieltje to the
Zonnebeke road, and on to the south over the
Menin Road.</p>

<p>The 28th Division troops, from the Ypres-Roulers
railway to the Bellewaarde Lake, were
in the thick of it, and were driven back <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
masse</i>.</p>

<p>The trenches of the 18th Hussars and 9th
Lancers were also in the path of the noxious
fumes; but the 1st Cavalry Brigade troops
further south escaped them.</p>

<p>For an hour the gas rolled westward, accompanied
by a cyclone of shell-fire, and followed
by a determined infantry attack.</p>

<p>No part of the cavalry line felt the gas more
than the left of the 18th Hussars, which was
held by a squadron under command of Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
MacLachlan, who arrived at Vlamertinghe
from England at seven o'clock the night
before. MacLachlan, with some of the half
dozen other officers and 130 men sent out
to replace the casualties suffered by the
18th Hussars on May 13th, was tramping
through Ypres within half an hour after he
joined the regiment. New to Flanders and
the Ypres Salient, his experience of a gas
attack before he had been in the firing line
twelve hours was a trying one.</p>

<p>MacLachlan was impressed by the warning
to be on the watch for gas, and was in his
forward trenches, awake and alert. His
respirator was ready, and he repeatedly told
his troopers to see that theirs were ready
also.</p>

<p>The gas was actually upon the men before
they could distinguish the poison-clouds from
the early morning haze that frequently hung
over the lake.</p>

<p>The first thick mantle of gas scattered the
18th Hussars somewhat, but enough of them
remained in the trenches to hold on until a
German machine-gun opened on them from
their left rear. Seizing the advantage offered
by the retirement of the 28th Division troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the Huns came on as swiftly as the dispersing
gas would allow, and soon were well behind
the 18th line.</p>

<p>MacLachlan, later in the day, tried to write
a diary of what happened to him during the
early morning hours, but it contained little
detail. To piece together a coherent story of
such events was difficult.</p>

<p>"3.15 a.m., gassed out. 3.30, in again. 4.30,
some York and Durham Light Infantry officers
showed up. 5.15, twelve men left out of my
sixty-one. 5.30, six men left. 6.30, 15th
Hussars coming up." So ran the diary.</p>

<p>The Germans poured around the Bellewaarde
Lake on either side of it, and drove the few
remaining 18th Hussars out of the trenches by
an outflanking movement with sheer weight of
numbers. The troopers retired across the
Menin Road and trailed over the shell-swept
fields toward Zillebeke, and then on to the
southern edge of Ypres.</p>

<p>While the trenches on the lakeside and around
the Hooge Château were being torn from the
grasp of the 18th Hussars, the 9th Lancers on
the right, across the Menin Road, were fighting
like mad.</p>

<p>The gas so filled their trenches that at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
points the troopers leaped on the parapets into
the clearer air above, in full view of the advancing
Huns, and poured a fire into the German
ranks that dropped dozens of the enemy like
shot rabbits.</p>

<p>Captain Rex Benson, howling like a dervish
to make his instructions audible above the din
of battle, mounted a high bastion and so
directed the stream of fire of his squadron that
the oncoming rush in front of that trench was
stemmed.</p>

<p>A rifle-bullet smashed through Benson's arm
and badly shattered the bone, but he held on in
spite of his wounds until the first fierce Hun
attack was repulsed.</p>

<p>Major Beale-Browne, commanding the 9th
Lancers, at once realised the danger to his left
flank as the German bullets began to pour into
it across the Menin Road. Down the south
bank of the highway ran a communication
trench, which Beale-Browne at once ordered to
be transformed into a defence against a Hun
attack from the position that had been won by
the enemy from the 18th Hussars.</p>

<p>A small infantry counter-attack to recover
the lost ground at Hooge failed, though two
companies of the Buffs got a foothold in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
trenches north of the Menin Road, and not far
from Hooge Château.</p>

<p>Beale-Browne's headquarters were in the
Louave Wood, behind the Sanctuary Wood,
and not far distant from the Menin Road. He
and Captain "Bimbo" Reynolds, the Adjutant
of the 9th, who had been twice wounded that
morning, constituted the bulk of the garrison
of the Louave Wood, when they saw three or
four hundred Germans advancing from the
north towards the Menin Road, preparatory to
attacking the wood, and thus gaining the rear
of the 9th Lancers' trenches.</p>

<p>At that moment some York and Lancaster
Territorials, who had been sent up from reserve
in a wood south of the 9th, arrived. Beale-Browne
at once sent to the Infantry Brigade
for more of them. Lining the northern edge
of the little wood with the Terriers he waited
until the Huns began to stream across the
roadway, then swept them back with volley
after volley at close range.</p>

<p>This move and the gallant stand made by the
9th Lancers in their front line trenches, ably
aided by the York and Lancaster lads, saved
the day. A couple of squadrons of the 15th
Hussars also played a gallant part in saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
our important position south of the Menin
Road.</p>

<p>The cost to the 9th Lancers was heavy,
Captain Francis Grenfell, Captain "Algy"
Court, and Captain Noel Edwards were killed,
the latter dying from the effects of gas poisoning
after he had been taken to the hospital at
Bailleul.</p>

<p>Four other officers of the 9th were wounded,
several men were killed by the gas, and forty-eight
hours later the number of casualties,
including those gassed and missing, was still
over 100.</p>

<p>While the strenuous struggle was proceeding
in the front line trenches, little was known of
the actual results of the German attack. Every
man attached to Beale-Browne's headquarters,
except "Bimbo" Reynolds, was out of commission,
save the telegraphists, who hung on in
the poisoned air of the signals dug-out until all
the wires were swept away by the German
shells, and all communication with the rear
rendered impossible.</p>

<p>General Meakin took over the field command
of the Division, and Colonel "Tommy" Pitman
again took the 1st Cavalry Brigade.</p>

<p>The 4th D.G.'s, 15th Hussars, and 19th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Hussars in reserve in the G.H.Q. line, were as
badly gassed as though they had been in the
front trenches.</p>

<p>In spite of this, they pushed their depleted
ranks forward in support over ground where
shells were bursting in scores and hundreds,
and formed a new line along a road that ran
north from and at right angles to the Menin
Road, about 1,000 yards west of Hooge.</p>

<p>Here they held the enemy from making
further inroads into our territory, fighting
fiercely every hour of the long day.</p>

<p>The 15th Hussars and 19th Hussars suffered
heavy casualties, and the 9th Cavalry Brigade
lost one of its most popular officers in Captain
Griffiths, its Brigade Major, who was killed by
a shell.</p>

<p>The 4th Division front line held well, in
spite of the gas. The only 4th Division
trenches lost were along a front of 800 yards
from the Canadian Farm to the Ypres-Passchendaele
Road. The East Lancashires south
of that road hung on with a bull-dog grip until
help came and counter-attacks could be formed
and launched to retake the ground that had
been lost.</p>

<p>My friend in the 11th Hussars, from whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
diary I quoted a few paragraphs with reference
to the part the gallant 11th played in the battle
of May 13th, kept a most vivid series of notes
as to what happened in front of the 1st Cavalry
Brigade on that memorable 24th of May.</p>

<p>While the 11th Hussars were on the right
of the 9th Lancers, and therefore on the fringe
of the attack, a perusal of the following will
give an idea of what it meant to be in the front
line of the Ypres Salient on a bank holiday
in 1915:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"3 a.m.&mdash;Heavy firing, guns, rifles, Maxims,
on our left; faint smell of gas; just as dawn
breaks.</p>

<p>3.15.&mdash;All quiet on our immediate front,
heavy shelling going on all round. Every wire
cut between Brigade headquarters and ourselves,
and with the artillery.</p>

<p>3.45.&mdash;Still no touch with Brigade headquarters,
so messenger despatched. The
headquarters of the 11th, Bays, and 5th D.G.'s
are all close together in a wood behind the
trench line. The Bays and 5th Dragoon
Guards each have one squadron in hand; there
are also three companies of the 4th East Yorks
Territorials in brigade reserve in the same
wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>4.&mdash;The Bays send an officers' patrol to
the left.</p>

<p>4.20.&mdash;Heavy firing still continues on our
left. Telephone message sent to O.C.
A Squadron: "Try and get information of
situation on your left."</p>

<p>4.35.&mdash;Answer received: "Adjutant 9th
Lancers just passed here. Reports their centre
and left gassed. No attack so far."</p>

<p>4.45.&mdash;Lieutenant Milne's patrol of the Bays
returned. Report 9th Lancers have been
badly gassed, and retired from their trenches
in places, leaving big gaps. Reinforcements
have gone up, and line has, he thinks, been
re-established.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Captain Osborne, Brigade-Major, arrives
from Brigade headquarters. They have all
suffered severely from gas; the regiments in
G.H.Q. line have caught it very badly. The
shelling has been very heavy, great number of
casualties, men streaming back from all parts of
the line. When he left Brigade headquarters
they were in ignorance of the situation in any
part of the line. The only thing which kept
their hopes up was that not a single man of
the 1st Brigade had returned.</p>

<p>6.30.&mdash;Lieutenant Milne reports that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
went to Officer Commanding 9th Lancers, who
told him that his line was complete to fifty yards
north of the Menin Road. He has had many
men gassed, and has used up all his supports to
fill up gaps in the front line. He is pushing
reconnaissance to his left. Heard that the
Officer Commanding York and Lancaster
Regiment had his battalion in a wood about
600 yards east of us, so went over and
saw him. He has 1,000 men, and is reserve
to the section of the line from our right to
Hill 60. Got him to send two companies to
the Officer Commanding 9th Lancers.</p>

<p>7.30.&mdash;Lieutenant Hartman, 11th Hussars,
returned with his patrol. He had worked up
to the Menin Road, where he had found
Captain F. O. Grenfell, 9th Lancers, holding
on with a very few men, and asking urgently
for reinforcements of 200 men to strengthen
his line. As Lieutenant Hartman was leaving,
three platoons of infantry arrived.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Heavy attack on Hooge. All our
glasses are fixed on that point. The village
(now only a few ruined houses) is on a piece of
rising ground which commands, at close range,
the rear of our position. Withdrew one of the
11th Hussars' Maxims and laid it on the village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Can see our troops falling back. If Hooge
goes, we are in the soup. 9th Lancers headquarters
are in Louave Wood. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Beale-Brown is in'">Beale-Browne
is in</ins> command. He has still got one company
in hand.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;Still holding on at Hooge. Can see
more of our infantry moving up from Louave
Wood.</p>

<p>11.&mdash;Patrol reports "enemy have broken
through 18th Hussars' line north of Menin
Road, and are working down on the road in
rear of Hooge." Hear heavy firing in that
direction. Send Osborne to officer commanding
Y. and L. to get him to send three companies
to hold northern edge of Louave Wood, with
machine-gun and detachment at farm west of it.</p>

<p>12 noon.&mdash;Message sent by runner to Brigade
Headquarters: "Still holding on to Hooge,
but Germans are astride the Menin Road.
Could you push up counter-attack in that
direction? My line of retreat is covered by
German machine-guns in that direction. Several
orderlies have been wounded going backwards
and forwards."</p>

<p>12 noon.&mdash;First messenger returned from
Brigade headquarters. Counter-attack is being
organised. Messenger states that on his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
up he saw about 100 infantry straggling back
from the lines on our right, stating that their
"'ole battalion had been coot oop." If there
is any truth in their statement, we are in a
nasty position, so send off at once an officer's
patrol in that direction to clear up the situation,
and a squadron of the 5th D.G.'s to support the
patrol and form a flank protection in direction
of Maple Copse. No firing has been heard at
all on our right.</p>

<p>12.5 p.m.&mdash;Learn that there is a company of
Royal Engineers in the wood near the York
and Lancaster headquarters, so send them
following order: "Proceed with Y. and L. guide
to O.C. 9th Lancers in Louave Wood, and ask
him if he can find work for your fifty men in
consolidating the position on northern edge of
wood."</p>

<p>12.15.&mdash;Germans attacking right of 9th
Lancers' line and left of A Squadron, 11th
Hussars, with bombs. They are reported to
have broken the 9th Lancers' line at one point,
but been driven out again.</p>

<p>12.30.&mdash;Captain Lawson reports that section
of trench held by Territorials between his left
and 9th Lancers has been captured by Germans.
They are working down his trench with bombs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
The captured section slopes up from the stream,
and looks down on the A Squadron trench.</p>

<p>12.35.&mdash;Interview the officer commanding 4th
Yorks, explain the situation, and tell him to
take another company up, and with the one
already in the second line form a barrier behind
the captured portion, getting touch with the 9th
Lancers on his left and the 11th Hussars on his
right.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Message sent to officer commanding
9th Lancers: "Have pushed up a support to
form a barrier behind the captured trench.
Endeavour to get touch with them from the
switch trench. A counter attack is now taking
place from Potitjze towards Hooge."</p>

<p>1.30.&mdash;The pressure on the Menin Road
seems to be relieved. The Germans are still
bombing down Lawson's trench, but A Squadron
are putting up a good fight with bombs. Lieut.
Gunter has been killed.</p>

<p>2.25.&mdash;Message sent by runner to Brigade
headquarters. "At about 12.15 Germans
captured portion of 9th Lancers' trench close
to 11th Hussars' left. Company of East Yorks
sent up to form barrier behind broken line.
Switch on 9th Lancers' right is now held
instead of advanced trench. Western edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Hooge still held by mixed force of men. Send
me information of counter attack, for if Germans
establish themselves on Menin Road during the
night, position of brigade becomes untenable.
If it is proposed to retire from here it would
have to be done at night. Please inform
Officer Commanding 83rd Brigade that I have
had to call on all the York and Lancasters
except 250 men. Following is disposition of
line at present as known to me:&mdash;1st Brigade
line as taken over last night. 2nd Brigade&mdash;9th
Lancers, weakened by losses, with left on
Menin Road; right broken but being secured.
Remainder of 9th Lancers, with York and
Lancasters, have formed a line right along
north edge of wood facing north. They have
two machine-guns on their outer flank and
patrols to the Menin Road."</p>

<p>2.45.&mdash;Message sent to Brigade headquarters:
"Please arrange to send up to-night two
dozen hand grenades per regiment, and
detonators, most important; also two dozen
rifle grenades per regiment and two dozen
extra detonators per regiment, as the bombs
here are without detonators; also as many gas-sprayers
as possible. Ask 1st Cavalry Division
to send up trench mortars with Royal Horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Artillerymen or Royal Engineers to man them,
as our men don't understand them. They are
urgently required."</p>

<p>3 p.m.&mdash;No further developments. Situation
well in hand, but hope that counter-attack is
developing on north side Menin Road. Lawson
is holding on to the line of stream, but position
is untenable unless 2nd Brigade can re-establish
original line on their right. Make dispositions
for holding new line from left of B Squadron
down communication trench to the support
trench; thence along to where it joins up with
front line. The situation on the right down as
far as Hill 60 reported all right. The trenches
near Hill 60 visited by our patrol did not even
know that there was a fight going on. They
thought all the firing was a long way to their left.</p>

<p>4 p.m.&mdash;Situation unchanged. Have got
majority of A Squadron back into communicating
trench, moved up squadron of the Bays to
complete the line and join up with 9th Lancers.
Send following message to Lawson, who is still
holding on at the stream:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most of your squadron are now back in
communicating trench. Squadron of the Bays
and infantry are holding the second line. I
cannot send you up any more support; doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
your doing any good by holding on to present
line. If you cannot get away now, wait until
dark."</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Message sent to Officer Commanding
9th Lancers:&mdash;"Portion of front line marked
with crosses on accompanying sketch, has gone;
suggest your falling back and holding line
marked with red dots." Operations carried on
without any further alarms till dusk. We saw
the right flank of the counter-attack coming up
towards Hooge. The Y. and L. co-operated in
this movement.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Following received from Officer Commanding
York and Lancasters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our attack on the Menin Road has been
successful. All the enemy have been driven
back off the road as far as our left flank rests.
The companies have withdrawn to Louave
Wood after leaving a post on Menin Road,
facing north. Patrols have been pushed on to
the north to try and get touch with the counter-attack,
but these patrols will now be withdrawn,
and the Oxford Hussars will be asked to send
similar patrols. Some of the enemy have been
killed. Have collected their papers and identity
discs, and will send them to Brigade headquarters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after dark we received orders that the
Brigade would be relieved to-night, but it was
not till past midnight that the relieving regiments
arrived. During the hours between
dusk and midnight the enemy attacked
vigorously with bombs both B Squadron and
A Squadron trenches. At midnight the
16th Lancers arrived to take over. It was
obvious that it was going to be a tight fit to
defeat daylight. Not a moment was lost,
but it was nearly two o'clock before the last
squadron was relieved. The squadrons moved
off independently, keeping as far as possible on
the low ground. A violent fusilade commenced
on both flanks of the Salient, and "Spares"
were fairly flying about over our heads. The
Germans were making another gas attack, and
C Squadron, which took a more northerly
route, caught it slightly. Our casualties were
slight during the withdrawal, and it was quite
light by the time we reached Ypres. We raced
on through the town, as shells were falling
about in a most unpleasant manner. We got
back to Vlamertinghe at 4.30 a.m., the men
absolutely dead beat, having walked seven
miles across country at top speed. We dossed
down to sleep, most of the men preferring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
open to the wooden huts. Forty-eight hours
without a check has been a bit more than tiring.
The casualties for the 24th of May were two
officers killed, twelve men killed, twelve
wounded, and four died of wounds. Lieutenant
Poole, who was only slightly wounded on the
way back to Ypres, unfortunately succumbed
to tetanus a few days later at Boulogne.</p>
</div>

<p>After sweeping over the firing-line and drifting
past the G.H.Q. reserve line, on that Whit
Monday morning, the gas still moved westward.</p>

<p>H and I Battery men, caught in their dug-outs,
had a liberal share, and still more of the
poisonous fumes gathered in ruined Ypres, or
floated on to our divisional headquarters further
to the west. Some of the gas was carried as
far back as Vlamertinghe, between four and five
miles from the German trenches.</p>

<p>"Willie" Du Cros, running with his ambulance
convoy from Vlamertinghe to a dressing
station well west of Ypres, was sufficiently overcome
by gas to be for some hours dangerously ill.</p>

<p>Hardly a member of the 1st Cavalry Division
Staff, including General de Lisle himself, escaped
the gas fumes. Red and watery eyes, a pale
bluish tinge to the complexion, violent head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>aches,
and continual coughing were universal
for the greater part of the forenoon.</p>

<p>Gas shells continually burst over Ypres and
the roads near it. More than once I ran through
pockets of gas, apparently caused by these gas
shells. Every one of us wore respirators or
masks when near Ypres, though "Babe"
Nicholson inhaled sufficient gas through his
respirator to render him unconscious for five
minutes after a "dash up front."</p>

<p>General Mullens, of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade,
and Captain Paget, his Brigade Major, were
brought in a dangerous condition to our headquarters.
By night they were able to walk
about, but for a time it seemed quite possible
neither would recover.</p>

<p>That evening I asked General Mullens, who
was looking very ill, if he thought he was free
from the effects of the poisoning. "Somewhat,"
he answered. "No one could imagine
what the experience is like. The helplessness
and mental suffering of it are beyond description."</p>

<p>Ypres came in for another terrific bombardment
that day. The Menin Bridge and the
Menin Road proved such death-traps that they
were "closed to traffic" before the day was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Romer Williams, of General Mullens's staff,
came through Ypres with a message just as I
was going up.</p>

<p>"You have a fine bruise on your forehead,"
said I, pointing to a raw bump the size of a
goose-egg. "How did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I haven't an idea," he answered; "unless
a shell bounced off it. Some of 'em have come
close enough, so I thought they <em>might</em> have
done so. As I was coming back down the
Menin Road, an ammunition limber passed me,
the horses at full gallop. I watched them cross
the railway metals at the halt. The limber
jumped up into the air when it hit the crossing
and the horses seemed to be skimming the
ground, they were going at such a pace. Just
as the limber bumped up, a flash came, right
over it, and when the smoke rolled away the
road led clean on eastward, absolutely empty.
Not a sign of horse, man or limber remained.
A big howitzer shell must have hit it squarely
on the outfit, and swept it into the ditch like
the wind would sweep away a leaf. It was a
terrible thing to see."</p>

<p>Colonel Browne of the R.A.M.C. and his
staff worked like Trojans. Browne had not
slept since 7 o'clock on the previous morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and had a bad touch of gas, like everyone else
near headquarters.</p>

<p>At break of day the roads were full of
panting, coughing stragglers from the front.
Scores on scores staggered into the big front
gates of the château, and sank exhausted and
suffering on the deep grass that lined the drive-way.
The medical officers hastily gave such
relief as they could and packed the ambulances
full of the wounded and the worst of the gas
cases.</p>

<p>By 9 o'clock in the morning 600 gassed
men and 160 wounded had passed through
Colonel Browne's hands, more than four-fifths
of them members of the 28th or 4th Division
units.</p>

<p>The number of men who were wounded by
shell fire when coming back toward Ypres from
the gas-filled trenches was legion.</p>

<p>Five signal-corps men, attached to the
2nd Cavalry Brigade, were badly poisoned,
but managed to get back as far as the big
square at Ypres. They were in such a sorry
state that a passing officer advised them to lie
down on the broken cobbles of the Grande
Place until an ambulance could be sent for them.
They stretched out in a pathetic row, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
not lain there long when a Black Maria lit at
their feet, shoving them half a dozen yards over
the stones still in line, every man of the five
dead, killed before he knew of the coming of
the shell.</p>

<p>All day shattered men were brought to the
divisional dressing station near the château
gates. The wounds from the shells were
terrible.</p>

<p>A wounded sergeant of the Cheshires refused
a ride from east of Ypres in an ambulance,
cheerily saying that those who <em>could</em> walk
should do so, and not occupy space required
for those more severely hurt. He carried back
his full kit, tramping sturdily along with a grim
smile on his fine face. At the dressing station
a nasty bullet hole in his shoulder was disclosed,
which would have laid many a man flat on his
back.</p>

<p>"Good man, of the old school. New ones
can't touch 'em," commented a grizzled hospital
orderly, as the Cheshire sergeant passed out of
the room.</p>

<p>A Tommy, with bright eyes peeping from a
purple bit of face all but hidden by a mass of
white bandages, insisted on telling his story to
anyone who would listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has told his bally yarn half a dozen
times, sir," complained a hospital orderly to the
doctor. "I told him he was not to talk, but he
just can't keep his bloomin' mouth shut, he says."</p>

<p>"Nasty wound, too," remarked the doctor,
as we watched the talkative individual. "Bullet
went clean through his face, in one cheek and
out the other, and carried away every one of
his upper teeth."</p>

<p>But his injury had apparently increased his
volubility. We could hear his tale as he poured
it into the ear of a gunner, wounded in both
legs and unable to escape.</p>

<p>"You see the ol' gas stuff got us bad, some
on us," he explained. "But I got this 'ere
bloomin' smash in the jawr, and that took up
so much o' me bally time I didn't pay no
attention to no gas, you believe <em>me</em>! I warsn't
the only bloke lyin' there. They was a fair lot
o' our chaps near me.</p>

<p>"The snipin' was cruel. Some o' the poor
blokes that was bloomin' well shot already got
'it agin. I was jest thinkin' mine was comin'
when wot oh! 'ere comes three big Prooshuns,
tall as 'ouses. Good-day, Bill, says I to meself.
You next! It'll be the butt for <em>your</em> nut from
these 'ere lobsters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"But not a bit. They ups with me and carts
me over to a 'ouse. Leastwys it <em>wor</em> a 'ouse,
wonct. An' wot do <em>you</em> think! Them Prooshuns
give me a bloomin' fill o' cold coffee, like
Christians!</p>

<p>"'Bout this time the Buffs was comin' on an'
my Prooshuns had to skin out, rapid. They
didn't do nothin' to me only say, 'Ta-ta!' in
Dutch. The fire got so 'ot I crawled off down
a crick-thing full of the stinkinest stuff that
ever got called water. I rounded around, after
a while, an' come up back o' them Buffs a
little. They saw me and bloomin' near shot
my 'ead off, so I lay still.</p>

<p>"Then I crawled more. I 'ad got in front
of some more o' our chaps by then. Big 'uns
was goin' orf right there, an' 'eads was down,
you bet. I was gettin' closer, when a fat-'ead
sees me an' starts shootin'. I 'ollered, an' the
more I 'ollered the more 'e let off 'is silly
gun. 'E 'it my pore ol' cap, 'e did. Then
some cuss shuts 'im orf, an' they come out and
gets me.</p>

<p>"'Who are you?' says a orficer chap. 'I'm
damned if I know,' says I. 'I've been shot at
by everybody I've seen all mornin', except
three big 'Uns.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Mad,' says a cove, short-like. 'Send
'im in.'</p>

<p>"'An' 'ere I am, with no jawr much left.'</p>

<p>"'Humph,' commented the doctor as he
walked away. 'Guess he could stand the loss
of some more jaw and not kill him. He seems
to have plenty left.'"</p>

<p>A more sinister story was told by a trooper
shot through the thigh. He said the Germans
got into one of our trenches, in which they
found him and nine of his comrades. Five of
the ten had been hit. The Huns told the
wounded to crawl away to as safe a place as
they could find, and they straightway wriggled
off down the trench, as directed.</p>

<p>With a scowl on his face a big German said
to the five unwounded men, "We don't want
<em>you</em>. Go!" He pointed his finger to the
shell-swept field that led toward the British
reserve line. The five started on a run, but
had not gone far when the rat-tat-tat of a
machine-gun behind them commenced. In an
instant the air was full of bullets. Four of the
five men fell dead. The fifth was the man
who told the story. He fell, he said, at the
first sound of the quick-firer, and thus escaped
with a bullet through his leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Counter-attack followed counter-attack as the
day wore on. We launched a small one at
2.30 p.m., a larger one an hour later, and a
still larger one was planned for 6 o'clock.
This last was to win back the lost trenches
around the Hooge Château, past the Bellewaarde
Lake, and on to the north.</p>

<p>The British guns cleared the way splendidly
for the 6 o'clock attack. "Mother" shells
fell into a line of ruined houses near Hooge.
The Germans had placed several machine-guns
there, and as the 9·2 projectiles knocked the
bricks about their ears they scampered out like
chickens. A machine-gun not far away in the
9th Lancers' trenches poured a hail of bullets
into the Huns as they left cover, and numbers
were seen to fall.</p>

<p>The Royal Fusiliers were attacking, but when
their line "got up," the advantage was lost,
other enemy machine-guns had been brought
into the German trenches, and the attack
"fizzled out," no real gain having been made.</p>

<p>So night closed in. By 2 o'clock in the
morning of the next day the fresh 2nd Cavalry
Division troopers had relieved the tired men of
the 1st Cavalry Division, who were once more
brought back to the Vlamertinghe huts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cavalry had lost heavily, and was still
to lose before the second battle of Ypres was
finished, though the ground won by the Huns
on the 24th of May marked their furthermost
westerly advance.</p>

<p>The part played by the infantry in the second
Ypres struggle was greater, numerically, than
that of the cavalry, but the work done by the
troopers was of inestimable value. Their resistance
broke the back of the enemy's onslaught
at its most tense moments.</p>

<p>The work of the Queen's Bays on May 13th,
and the 9th Lancers and 15th Hussars on
May 24th, will long live in the annals of the
British Army.</p>

<p>The following officers were awarded the
Distinguished Service Order, the task of selection
for the awards from so great a number of
instances of gallant conduct during these May
days being a most difficult one:&mdash;</p>

<p>Major George Harold Abseil Ing, 2nd
Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays). At Ypres
on May 13th, 1915, when the line was broken
beyond the right flank of his regiment, he came
out of his trench in the front line, stood on the
road in the open under heavy shell-fire, stopped
the retirement of forty men of another unit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
turned them into his section of the defence.
The good results of his gallant action were
far-reaching.</p>

<p>Major Charles William Henry Crichton, 10th
(Prince of Wales Own Royal) Hussars. Near
Ypres, on May 13th, 1915, showed conspicuous
gallantry and ability in collecting and rallying
men who were retiring under heavy shell-fire
through the 10th Hussars' position. In our
counter-attack he continued to direct operations,
giving great encouragement to his men
whilst he lay in the open under heavy shell-fire
with his leg shattered.</p>

<p>Captain John Grey Porter, 9th (Queen's
Royal) Lancers. On May 10th, 1915, when a
very heavy attack was made on the front line
near Hooge, Captain Porter went up to the
infantry line there and brought back very valuable
information regarding the situation. On
May 13th he rendered the greatest possible
assistance in taking messages under terrific
shell-fire to various parts of the line, and
reporting on various local situations. He set
an example of coolness and total disregard of
danger that was beyond all praise. He has
been twice wounded previously in this campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>The following eight cavalry officers were
awarded the Military Cross for their work in
the Salient:&mdash;</p>

<p>Captain Stewart Graham Menzies, D.S.O.,
2nd Life Guards. Near Ypres, on May 13th,
1915, after his Commanding Officer had been
wounded, displayed conspicuous ability, coolness
and resource in controlling the action of his
regiment and rallying the men.</p>

<p>Captain Edward Archibald Ruggles-Brise,
Essex Yeomanry, T.F. For conspicuous
gallantry and ability, near Ypres, on May 13th,
1915, when he held a position gained in a
counter-attack, although entirely isolated, until
ordered to withdraw at night. He had only
fifty men under his command.</p>

<p>Captain Guy Franklin Reynolds, 9th (Queen's
Royal) Lancers. For splendid work on May
24th, 1915, near Hooge. When the headquarters
of the 9th Lancers were gassed, he
constantly brought reports from the trenches
under very heavy fire, and helped to reorganise
the defence of the left section. Also when
the enemy attempted to enter Louave Wood,
he was invaluable in helping to reorganise
the defence. He set the finest possible
example of calmness, coolness, and courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
although suffering from gas and twice slightly
wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Charles Joseph Leicester Stanhope,
15th (The King's) Hussars. For gallant and
skillful handling of his squadron, near Hooge,
on May 24th, 1915, with most valuable results.
His squadron, having been badly gassed, he
took forward the remnants, together with
stragglers he collected, and on his own initiative,
under very heavy shell-fire, reinforced the front
line. He remained in action all day, and when
the line on his left gave way he doubled back
his flank with great skill, and continued with
the utmost gallantry to hold the position.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Kenneth Douglas Lorne Maclaine
of Lochbuie, 15th (The King's) Hussars
(S.R.). Near Ypres, for good work in command
of his squadron under trying circumstances,
on May 13th, 1915. For gallant and
skilful leading of a patrol on May 14th, by
which he gained information of great value.
He volunteered to lead this patrol, and pushed
forward by day, a mile in front of our line, and
returned with a good report as to the actual
line then held by the enemy. For coolness,
determination and skill in handling his squadron
under difficult circumstances near Hooge on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
May 24th, 1915. He had been ordered up
with his squadron to reinforce the left of
another cavalry regiment, when the line north
of the Menin Road gave way, and the situation
became critical. Lieutenant Maclaine showed
great skill in taking up a new position, facing
north and west to meet the new situation, and
maintained his position under most critical
circumstances until relieved at 2.15 the next
morning. His action contributed greatly towards
maintaining intact the line south of the
road.</p>

<p>Lieutenant William Spurrett Fielding
Johnson, Leicestershire Yeomanry, T.F. For
conspicuous gallantry near Ypres on May 13th,
1915. Was with Major Martin, and continued
the action until the squadron was reduced to
thirteen men. Afterwards displayed great
coolness in withdrawing to a flank and joining
a cavalry brigade.</p>

<p>Lieutenant James Archibald Garton, North
Somerset Yeomanry, T.F. Near Ypres on
May 13th, 1915, showed great coolness and
daring. Held his position throughout the day,
notwithstanding that the trenches had been
blown in, and inspired all ranks by his behaviour.
After all senior officers were killed or wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
he assumed command of the regiment, displaying
great judgment and initiative throughout.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Nigel Kennedy Worthington,
3rd Dragoon Guards (S.R.). Near Ypres on
May 12th, 1915, showed great coolness and
daring. He took over a new line of trenches
just before dark, and to get round the line in
daylight, he had to cross several open and fire-swept
zones. On May 13th, at great risk, he
came back several times to report.</p>

<p>From the foregoing list of honours it would
be unfair to omit the Distinguished Service
Order given for magnificent work a week after
the fight on May 24th, to Major Philip Granville
Mason, of the 3rd (Prince of Wales')
Dragoon Guards. "Whilst in command of
Hooge Fort and the adjoining trenches," the
official report read, "he showed conspicuous
gallantry and ability in holding the village and
defence line allotted to him, notwithstanding a
terrific bombardment for several hours every
day from May 30th to June 2nd, 1915, in which
practically all his trenches and dug-outs were
blown in."</p>

<p>On the 25th the regiments took stock of
their losses and began the work of refitting.
I called at the headquarters of Colonel Burnett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of the 18th Hussars, hearing he was in a
dangerous condition from gas poisoning. No
one was allowed to see him, and fears for his
recovery were expressed by those who attended
him. Burnett was soon afterwards sent home,
where he was compelled to spend many long
months of convalescence before he was able to
rejoin his regiment.</p>

<p>Acting Adjutant Hill, of the 18th Hussars,
had not been able to make out any accurate list
of casualties. Two officers of the regiment
were known to have been killed by gas, and
five others were wounded. The killed, wounded
and missing totalled nearly 190 out of less than
300. Many of the missing, it was hoped, would
prove to have been gassed but slightly, and be
able soon to resume their duties.</p>

<p>As the sun went down that evening their
comrades of the 9th Lancers buried the bodies
of Francis Grenfell and "Algy" Court.</p>

<p>Court's face wore a smile, as though he was
quietly sleeping. Grenfell, shot through the
heart at the height of the battle, bore, too, a
look of deep peace, as if at last he had cheerfully
gone to a better country, to join his beloved
brother "Rivy," from the shock of whose death,
on the Aisne, Francis had never recovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Staunch friends and fine men, both Grenfell
and Court.</p>

<p>Whatever Peace may bring us, it can never
replace the ones War has taken.</p>

<p>But they have left behind them their example,
and the memory of the clean, young manhood
that England gave, without stint, to fight for
the right. With that memory enshrined in the
hearts of those they have left behind, victory
lies not with the grave, for such lives are
deathless.</p>

<p>At an early hour on the 26th of May, General
de Lisle was apprised of his appointment to the
command of the 29th Division, which had won
splendid laurels under General Hunter Weston
in the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>My long and pleasant association with de
Lisle bade fair to close, much to my regret.</p>

<p>In the course of conversation I told the
General how sorry I was that I was not to
accompany him.</p>

<p>"I much wish that you were," said he. "I
doubt if I can take you to the Dardanelles; but
if you care to come with me to London and the
War Office, I will do what I can to have you
attached to my new Division."</p>

<p>After a morning of racing back and forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
between the front and St. Omer, we sped to
Boulogne, arriving in time to catch the afternoon
boat.</p>

<p>No one could have been kinder than General
Long, the Director of Supplies and Transport
at the War Office. In his office, next morning,
I met General de Lisle; but General Long
could only tell us that "it will very likely be
a long, long time before motor cars will be
required in the Dardanelles; and, as you know,
Americans are not eligible for commissions in
the British Army, even should you apply for
one."</p>

<p>So back I went to General Headquarters in
France, deeply sorry to say "Good-bye" to
General de Lisle and his magnificent 1st
Cavalry Division.</p>

<p><b>The Times</b>:&mdash;"There have been many books written about the war, but not one
has told of actual fighting a tithe of what Frederic Coleman tells us in 'From Mons
to Ypres with French.' ... It is a book which will surely live, and ought to be read."</p>

<p><b>Daily Telegraph</b> (First Notice):&mdash;"Mr. Coleman's Book, intensely interesting from
cover to cover, is much more than the vivid diary of a shrewd observer. It is a detailed
history of the military operations which governed the earlier and opening phases of the great
War in the West. The volume might well be the work of a General Headquarters Staff
Officer, permitted by some revolutionised War Office to speak his mind."</p>

<p><b>Punch</b>:&mdash;"Driving as he did a motor-car for the British Headquarters, and in particular
General de Lisle, he saw as much fighting as any man need wish for. Even those who have
overloaded their shelves with books about the war must find a place for 'From Mons to Ypres
with French.'"</p>

<p><b>The Sphere</b>:&mdash;"A most absorbing narrative of war experiences. Again and again
Mr. Coleman pours out his admiration for the British Army and expresses his pride at being
able to serve with them.... The book is a perfectly unpretentious record of the author's
personal services and adventures, and contains much careful description of military events
and at times sound criticism."</p>

<p><b>Dally Chronicle</b>:&mdash;"The book is so full of detail, so careful in explaining military
events, that while it will be read with interest now, it should not be overlooked when the time
comes for writing an authoritative history of the British campaign in Flanders and France."</p>

<p><b>Morning Post</b>:&mdash;"'From Mons to Ypres' is written throughout in language without
literary frills of any kind, and is the liveliest chronicle which has yet been published of our
glorious soldiers.... The book is full of authentic humour and high spirits, and everybody
should read it."</p>

<p class="pfs80"><em>Reprinted with permission from "The Spectator," May 20th, 1916.</em></p>

<div class="fs70">
<p class="drop-capx">English politicians and journalists deserve some credit for the manner
in which they have dealt with the attitude assumed by the United
States of America during the present war. The policy pursued by
President Wilson has unquestionably caused some surprise and disappointment
on this side of the Atlantic. But the discussion has always been characterized
by great restraint. Language calculated to wound the national susceptibilities
of Americans has been studiously avoided. By far the most severe of
President Wilson's critics have been his own countrymen. Several causes have
contributed to bring about this result. Of these, the most important has been
the fact that the genuine friendship entertained by most Englishmen for their
Transatlantic kinsmen has made them very reluctant to criticize. Then, again,
incipient criticism has been checked by a feeling that we owe some atonement
for the harsh judgment most unfortunately passed by some sections of English
society on American policy during the great struggle of half-a-century ago;
by a just appreciation of the fact that, whatever we might think, Americans
are not only the sole, but also the best judges of the conduct of their own
Government; and by the reflection that the difficulties which beset President
Wilson cannot be fully realized on this side of the Atlantic. But, in addition
to these causes, there has been another which has largely contributed to prevent
any estrangement between the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race.
Englishmen, although they have been somewhat astonished at the equanimity
with which the frequent German outrages against American life and property
have been endured, have never resented the neutral attitude adopted by the
United States Government; but they have felt that President Wilson failed
to rise to the situation, that he did not adequately appreciate the extent to
which the greatest democracy of the world was interested in the struggle
against absolutism, and that, without any departure from an attitude of strict
neutrality, a greater amount of sympathy might have been displayed for
those who are the champions of progress and civilization against retrogression
and an abhorrent State morality. At the same time, they felt that the attitude
of official America did not accurately represent the real feelings and sentiments
of the American public, or at all events of that portion of the public whose
views were most entitled to respect. Hence, it has resulted that the opinions
expressed by individual Americans, who were untrammelled by official
responsibilities, have served as a healthy antidote to the acts and language of
their Government. Amongst this class Mr. Frederic Coleman is entitled to
occupy a distinguished place. In the very spirited and graphic account which
he has written of his personal experiences with the British Expeditionary
Force in France, he speaks with no uncertain voice. "Friends and readers,"
he says, "do not forget that most Americans feel much the same as I feel
about the war. An overwhelming majority of those of my countrymen who
know the truth would do what lies in their power to further the success of the
Allies and their righteous cause." Moreover, he arraigns the criminal
monarch who has been instrumental in bringing about the greatest catastrophe
the world has ever witnessed before the bar of human and Divine justice.
Speaking of the gallant Grenfell twin brothers, both of whom were sacrificed
on the altar of German ambition, he uses words which should find a
responsive echo in many a sorely-stricken French and English home. "Fine
men of noble character, the Grenfells. Surely the monarch responsible for a
war that mows down the flower of the world's manhood in the fulness of its
youth must one day answer for his crime, in this world or the next."</p>

<p>Mr. Coleman was not, as is usually the case with civilians who are
attached to an army in the field, constrained to keep out of the fighting line.
On the contrary, it is clear from his stirring personal narrative that most of
his time was passed within the region in which a hail of "Black Marias,"
shrapnell shells, and Mauser bullets has been asserting Germany's right to
occupy "a place in the sun" by slaughtering the youth of England, by
devastating the fair homesteads of France, and by reducing to ruins the sacred
buildings and historic monuments of which French soil is so prolific. Mr.
Coleman does not profess to write a history of the operations of which he
was a witness. He frequently dwells on a point which is too often forgotten
by those who read the accounts given by the actors in the great struggle. It
is that each individual can only bear testimony to what passes before his own
eyes. Very few are in possession of information which would enable them to
judge of the relative importance of events. "No one," Mr. Coleman says,
"would imagine how little regimental officers, or Brigade commanders for
that matter, know of the broad plan of operations." But Mr. Coleman
provides us with a very vivid picture of what he himself saw, and thus
enables us to realize the general character which the war must have assumed
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleman joined the Expeditionary Force in August, 1914, about the
time when the retirement from Mons and its neighbourhood began. His
account of this operation is deeply interesting. It would be altogether
premature to discuss, and still more to criticize, the strategy of which this
movement was the outcome. Moreover, the British commanders were in no
way responsible for the early strategy of the campaign. They merely had to
make their military dispositions conform to the requirements of the plan
which had been already elaborated and partially executed by the French
General Staff, and that plan necessitated a withdrawal from the advanced position
originally occupied by the British troops in Flanders. A retreat does not
necessarily connote permanent defeat or irretrievable disaster. When the
Duke of Wellington withdrew within the lines of Torres Vedras, he did so
deliberately in order to prepare for the advance which eventually drove the
invaders from Spanish territory. It is greatly to be hoped that the history of
Torres Vedras will be repeated at Salonika. Nevertheless, retreat generally
involves at least a temporary check. It disheartens the rank-and-file of an
army, more especially if it is the sequel of some local success in one portion
of the field of operations. Describing the situation at St. Quentin on August
27th, 1914, Mr. Coleman says: "An orderly, well-disciplined army had
been through a great fight. Its infantry, unbeaten by the infantry that
opposed it, had been ordered to retire. 'Gawd knows why,' hundreds of
Tommies were saying.... Everything tended to discouragement." Retreat,
in the presence of an advancing enemy, flushed with the full confidence
of victory, is one of the most delicate and difficult of military operations,
and one also that affords a crucial test of the discipline and morale of the
retreating force. To such an extent has this been recognized that the
successful retreats recorded in history have shed a very special degree of lustre
on those in command and on the troops whom they conducted. After a lapse
of twenty-three centuries, the account of the retreat of the famous Ten
Thousand after the battle of Cunaxa is still read with undiminished interest and
admiration. The operations of Jovian after the crushing defeat inflicted on
the Emperor Julian in Persia are still cited as an instance of what can be
accomplished by a highly trained and well-disciplined army. Sir John
Moore's retreat to Corunna is another case in point, and the heroic action of
Ney's rearguard during the retreat from Moscow, although it could not avert
disaster, nobly redeemed the honour of the French Army. The retreat of
the British force from Mons should find an honoured place side by side with
these celebrated episodes.</p>

<p>Good leadership was not wanting. Smith-Dorrien, Haig, and others
deserved well of their country. But the honours of the day lay mainly with the
regimental officers and men. "The very air," Mr. Coleman says, "was full
of unostentatious heroism." He was told to "cheer the men up" as they
straggled, ragged, muddy, and footsore, past him. He soon found that
"many of us had been labouring under a great delusion. It was not that
some one was needed to cheer up the Tommy; it was that most of us needed
the Tommies to cheer <em>us</em> up." An Irishman came by with a hole drilled
through the lobe of his ear by a Mauser bullet. "Close that, I'm thinkin',"
said the proud owner of the damaged member, "and I niver knew how close
me ear was to me head till that thing come along." The following story also
illustrates the spirit of the men, and shows what a capable officer with an
innate genius for leadership can do in very difficult circumstances. Major
Bridges, of the 4th Dragoon Guards, found a couple of hundred men of
various detachments seated on the pavement in the square at St. Quentin in a
state of complete exhaustion. They had been for thirty-six hours without food
or sleep. He at once recognized that "no peremptory order, no gentle request,
no clever cajolery would suffice." He therefore went into a toy-shop and bought
a toy drum and a penny whistle. Then he asked the trumpeter whether he could
play "The British Grenadiers." "Sure, Sir," was the reply. So the trumpeter
whistled, and the gallant Major drummed vigorously. "The spark caught!
Some with tears in their eyes, some with a roar of laughter, jumped to their
feet and fell in. The weary feet, sore and bruised, tramped the hard cobbles
unconscious of their pain. Stiffened limbs answered to the call of newly
awakened wills.... 'Go on, Colonel! we'll follow you to hell,' sings out a
brawny Irishman behind, who can just hobble along on his torn feet."</p>

<p>Instances of this sort, showing "the indomitable will and the unconquerable
power of the Anglo-Saxon," abound in Mr. Coleman's pages.
A wounded officer with a shot through his shoulder murmurs "'Only a
scratch,' with an attempt at a smile as he passes on." Major Budworth, of
the Royal Horse Artillery, visits his wounded men. "'Promise, Sir, that
I can come back to H Battery when I am right,' was the one thing they had
to ask, the one desire of their hearts." "The General [Lawford]," a young
officer said, "plugged on ahead of all of us, waving a big white stick over
his head and shouting like a banshee. There was no stopping him. He
fairly walked into the Germans, and we after him on the run.... How
Lawford escaped being hit is more than any one can tell. I can see him now,
his big stick waving in the air, and he shouting and yelling away like mad,
though you couldn't hear a word of what he said above the sinful noise.
My Sam, he did yell at us! Wonder what he said?" Lord Cavan,
Mr. Coleman tells us, "was almost a demi-god in the eyes of his devoted
men." He also speaks of the bravery of young Chance, of the 4th Dragoon
Guards, and adds: "Truly an army containing a multitude of youths of that
mould may well be termed invincible." "Ah!" said one "grizzled
Brigadier," with the tears rolling down his cheeks, "they may be able to <em>kill</em>
such men, but they will never be able to <em>beat</em> them."</p>

<p>Experience has proved that in time of war, to whatever height passions
may be aroused amongst non-combatants, national animosity amongst the
actual combatants is to some extent tempered by the admiration and respect
which all brave men feel for foemen worthy of their steel. Mr. Coleman
quotes a letter written by a German officer to a friend in Zürich, in which he
said: "If we Germans were given to understand formerly that the English
soldiers were not to be feared, then that idea may now be banished from our
minds, for the general opinion of those who have fought against them in these
districts is that one Englishman is more dangerous than any two of the
Allies." On the other hand, an English trooper, speaking to Mr. Coleman
of the fight at Messines, said: "They was plucky beggars, if they <em>was</em>
Germans. <em>I</em> don't want to see no pluckier. They've been killed off like
pigs up there, in that town, and they keep on comin'. They fight stiff, that
lot&mdash;they fight damn stiff!"</p>

<p>When the day of peace returns, and we again relapse into the state when
possibly "God will be forgotten and the soldier slighted," let us endeavour
to remember that, if the world is not dominated by the mail-fisted Kaiser,
who has converted the half of Europe into a shambles, the delivery is due to
the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poilus</i>, to the British "Tommies," and to their officers, whose
countless graves studded over the bloodstained fields of Flanders bear ample
testimony to their heroism. And let it also be remembered that the hordes of
poor German peasants and artisans who were driven to the slaughter by the
politicians of Berlin also possessed some virtues. They fought in a bad
cause, which was not that of progressive civilization and which was never
truly explained to them, but they fought "damn stiff."</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
